     The primary objective of space biology research is to develop a comprehensive
     understanding of how spaceflight influences living systems. This includes both experimental 
     studies conducted on spacecraft such as the International Space Station (ISS) and ground-based
     investigations designed to simulate specific aspects of space conditions, such as microgravity or 
     radiation exposure. Insights gained from these studies are essential for preparing humanity for 
     long-duration missions and potential colonization efforts beyond Earth.
     With the advancement of space travel technologies, humanity has gradually extended its
     presence beyond terrestrial boundaries. Historically, such missions were accessible only to highly 
     trained astronauts who underwent rigorous physical and psychological preparation. However, the emergence 
     of private space companies and the commercialization of space tourism have introduced the possibility that
     , in the near future, space travel may no longer be restricted to professional astronauts alone. Instead, 
     it may become a feasible experience for civilians, thereby transforming our understanding of human
     adaptation to extraterrestrial environments and raising new scientific, medical, and ethical questions 
     about sustaining life beyond Earth.
