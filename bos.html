          Primary Objective: The main goal was to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term microgravity exposure and subsequent recovery.
Animal Model: The principal species used was the male C57/BL6 mouse. The decision to use males was based on their larger size and the absence of sex steroid cycling, although group-housing mature males presented a recognized challenge.
Experimental Groups: The study included four experimental groups (plus a backup group):
Space Flight (SF): Mice flown for 30 days in microgravity.
Ground Control (GC): Mice housed on the ground in refurbished flight habitats that replicated the spacecraft's environmental and housing conditions.
Vivarium Controls (SFV and GCV): Mice housed in the standard animal facility to account for housing and possible seasonal effects.
Measurements: The experiment combined in vivo measurements (including continuous blood pressure monitoring via implanted telemetry and video recording of behavior) with extensive in vitro studies conducted both immediately post-flight and after a 7-day recovery period.
Mouse Training and Selection
The preparatory program was crucial for the successful execution of the automated, unmanned, 30-day mission.
Co-adaptation: Male mice were trained for social housing in stable cohorts of three in the cylindrical BOS (Unit for the Provision of Housing) habitats. This training aimed to reduce aggression, which was a risk when group-housing mature males.
Diet Adaptation: Mice were adapted to a paste food diet developed specifically for the mission, which eliminated the need for a separate water supply as the paste contained sufficient water.
In Vivo Training/Selection: Mice designated for in vivo studies underwent a broader training program and a preliminary test battery to select homogenous groups. This included:
Behavioral/Functional Tests: Open field test, Grip force measurement, and the RotaRod test.
Automated Monitoring: Continuous measurement of activity, running wheel use, and blood pressure (for implanted mice) in a TSE Phenomaster system.
Outcomes and Conclusions
Post-Flight Condition: After the flight, surviving mice were in good condition for biomedical studies but displayed signs of pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity. Post-flight examination showed impaired motor function, inability to maintain steady posture, and excessive toe spreading.
Behavioral Changes: In the open-field test post-flight, the flight mice showed drastically reduced locomotor activity (distance moved and rearing frequency) and increased grooming duration compared to ground controls.
Survivorship: The overall survivorship in the space flight group was 16 out of 30 mice (53%) in the functioning habitats. The paper notes that aggression was not the cause of death; instead, it hypothesizes that mice spent considerable time
 huddling near the feeder wall in the cylindrical habitat, possibly leading to injuries or death due to contact with moving parts or hardware.
Conclusion: The authors concluded that their extensive pre-flight program was effective and that male mice can be successfully employed in long-duration space biomedical research, but recommended that future habitat designs must be better adapted for mice by removing any moving parts accessible to the animals.

        The study exposed 16-week-old female
C57BL/6J mice (n=8) to microgravity for 15 days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. The results revealed that bone loss in microgravity is a complex process involving all three major bone cell types:
Osteoclastic Activity (Bone Resorption):
Analysis of the proximal femur showed that the bone surface covered by
 TRAP-positive osteoclasts (bone-resorbing cells) increased by 154% in microgravity samples compared to ground controls.
Osteocytic Osteolysis (Osteocyte-mediated Degradation):
High-resolution X-ray nano-computed tomography (
nanoCT) of the pelvis revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis.
The lacunae (spaces occupied by osteocytes, the most abundant bone cells) showed an increase in
 cross-sectional area (+17%) and perimeter (+14%).
The expression of the matrix metalloproteinase
 MMP10 was significantly up-regulated (+16.85 fold) and was specifically localized to osteocytes, indicating their active role in degrading the surrounding matrix.
Osteoblastic Cell Cycle Arrest (Inhibited Bone Formation):
Bone formation by
 osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) was likely inhibited by the dramatic up-regulation (3.31 fold) of the cell cycle inhibitor gene CDKN1a/p21.
CDKN1a/p21 protein was found to be specifically localized to the osteoblasts along the periosteal surface, suggesting it inhibits the cell cycle during tissue regeneration.
Consistent with this, gene expression analysis showed suppression of pro-osteogenic growth and proliferation genes, including down-regulation of
 Bmp−4 (-1.99 fold) and Tgf−β2 (-1.59 fold).


Pelvic Bone Loss and Conclusion
Quantitative Loss: Micro-computed tomography (μCT) analysis of the ischial region of the pelvis confirmed the loss, showing a 6.29% decrease in Bone Volume Fraction (BV/TV) and an 11.91% decrease in overall bone thickness in the spaceflight mice.
Conclusion: The findings identify the pelvic and femoral region as an active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity. The study concludes that microgravity-induced bone loss is not limited to the commonly known osteoclast-mediated degradation, but also involves previously unrecognized
 osteocytic osteolysis and CDKN1a/p21-mediated osteogenic cell cycle arrest. The activation of
 CDKN1a/p21 is highlighted as a potential major concern for tissue regenerative health during long-duration spaceflight.
