                data-content="Primary Objective: The main goal was to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term microgravity exposure and subsequent recovery.
Animal Model: The principal species used was the male C57/BL6 mouse. The decision to use males was based on their larger size and the absence of sex steroid cycling, although group-housing mature males presented a recognized challenge.
Experimental Groups: The study included four experimental groups (plus a backup group):
Space Flight (SF): Mice flown for 30 days in microgravity.
Ground Control (GC): Mice housed on the ground in refurbished flight habitats that replicated the spacecraft's environmental and housing conditions.
Vivarium Controls (SFV and GCV): Mice housed in the standard animal facility to account for housing and possible seasonal effects.
Measurements: The experiment combined in vivo measurements (including continuous blood pressure monitoring via implanted telemetry and video recording of behavior) with extensive in vitro studies conducted both immediately post-flight and after a 7-day recovery period.
Mouse Training and Selection
The preparatory program was crucial for the successful execution of the automated, unmanned, 30-day mission.
Co-adaptation: Male mice were trained for social housing in stable cohorts of three in the cylindrical BOS (Unit for the Provision of Housing) habitats. This training aimed to reduce aggression, which was a risk when group-housing mature males.
Diet Adaptation: Mice were adapted to a paste food diet developed specifically for the mission, which eliminated the need for a separate water supply as the paste contained sufficient water.
In Vivo Training/Selection: Mice designated for in vivo studies underwent a broader training program and a preliminary test battery to select homogenous groups. This included:
Behavioral/Functional Tests: Open field test, Grip force measurement, and the RotaRod test.
Automated Monitoring: Continuous measurement of activity, running wheel use, and blood pressure (for implanted mice) in a TSE Phenomaster system.
Outcomes and Conclusions
Post-Flight Condition: After the flight, surviving mice were in good condition for biomedical studies but displayed signs of pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity. Post-flight examination showed impaired motor function, inability to maintain steady posture, and excessive toe spreading.
Behavioral Changes: In the open-field test post-flight, the flight mice showed drastically reduced locomotor activity (distance moved and rearing frequency) and increased grooming duration compared to ground controls.
Survivorship: The overall survivorship in the space flight group was 16 out of 30 mice (53%) in the functioning habitats. The paper notes that aggression was not the cause of death; instead, it hypothesizes that mice spent considerable time
 huddling near the feeder wall in the cylindrical habitat, possibly leading to injuries or death due to contact with moving parts or hardware.
Conclusion: The authors concluded that their extensive pre-flight program was effective and that male mice can be successfully employed in long-duration space biomedical research, but recommended that future habitat designs must be better adapted for mice by removing any moving parts accessible to the animals.

                data-content="The study exposed 16-week-old female
C57BL/6J mice (n=8) to microgravity for 15 days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. The results revealed that bone loss in microgravity is a complex process involving all three major bone cell types:
Osteoclastic Activity (Bone Resorption):
Analysis of the proximal femur showed that the bone surface covered by
 TRAP-positive osteoclasts (bone-resorbing cells) increased by 154% in microgravity samples compared to ground controls.
Osteocytic Osteolysis (Osteocyte-mediated Degradation):
High-resolution X-ray nano-computed tomography (
nanoCT) of the pelvis revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis.
The lacunae (spaces occupied by osteocytes, the most abundant bone cells) showed an increase in
 cross-sectional area (+17%) and perimeter (+14%).
The expression of the matrix metalloproteinase
 MMP10 was significantly up-regulated (+16.85 fold) and was specifically localized to osteocytes, indicating their active role in degrading the surrounding matrix.
Osteoblastic Cell Cycle Arrest (Inhibited Bone Formation):
Bone formation by
 osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) was likely inhibited by the dramatic up-regulation (3.31 fold) of the cell cycle inhibitor gene CDKN1a/p21.
CDKN1a/p21 protein was found to be specifically localized to the osteoblasts along the periosteal surface, suggesting it inhibits the cell cycle during tissue regeneration.
Consistent with this, gene expression analysis showed suppression of pro-osteogenic growth and proliferation genes, including down-regulation of
 Bmpâˆ’4 (-1.99 fold) and Tgfâˆ’Î²2 (-1.59 fold).


Pelvic Bone Loss and Conclusion
Quantitative Loss: Micro-computed tomography (Î¼CT) analysis of the ischial region of the pelvis confirmed the loss, showing a 6.29% decrease in Bone Volume Fraction (BV/TV) and an 11.91% decrease in overall bone thickness in the spaceflight mice.
Conclusion: The findings identify the pelvic and femoral region as an active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity. The study concludes that microgravity-induced bone loss is not limited to the commonly known osteoclast-mediated degradation, but also involves previously unrecognized
 osteocytic osteolysis and CDKN1a/p21-mediated osteogenic cell cycle arrest. The activation of
 CDKN1a/p21 is highlighted as a potential major concern for tissue regenerative health during long-duration spaceflight.

                data-content="The files, which include a detailed review of cellular biology in microgravity and two animal-model studies, outline a range of profound changes induced by the space environment. These effects carry dual implications for safeguarding
astronaut health during long missions and advancing terrestrial regenerative medicine and oncology.
Bone Health and Mechanotransduction
Microgravity rapidly accelerates bone mass loss through complex cellular mechanisms.
Multi-Cellular Degradation: Bone loss is not only due to increased osteoclast (bone-resorbing cell) activity, but also involves previously unrecognized processes.
Osteocytic Osteolysis: Microgravity causes osteocytes (cells embedded in bone) to actively degrade their surrounding bone matrix, evidenced by an increase in lacunae size and up-regulation of the matrix-degrading enzyme MMP10.
Inhibited Formation: Osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) show cell cycle arrest due to the significant up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor gene CDKN1a/p21.
Structural Changes: In osteoblasts, microgravity reduces cell stiffness and decreases levels of actin filaments, a key cytoskeletal component necessary for sensing and responding to mechanical stimuli (mechanotransduction).
Impact: A 15-day space mission in mice resulted in a 6.29% decrease in Bone Volume Fraction (BV/TV) in the pelvis. Applying mechanical pressure was found to partially restore critical molecular signaling pathways in osteoblasts under microgravity.




Immune System and Systemic Homeostasis
Microgravity disrupts the immune system and affects key organ functions, potentially increasing susceptibility to illness.
Immune Dysfunction: Microgravity significantly compromises immune cell function, leading to increased vulnerability to infections.
T Cells: T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production (e.g., IL-2, IFNâˆ’Î³) are suppressed, and T cell apoptosis is accelerated.
Other Cells: Dendritic cells show reduced antigen presentation capability, while Natural Killer (NK) cells exhibit decreased cytotoxic activity.
Molecular Pathways: Critical signaling cascades like RAS, ERK, and NF-ÎºB are disrupted, further contributing to immune dysregulation.
Hepatic (Liver) and Intestinal Changes: Microgravity alters metabolic function.
The liver develops changes akin to metabolic disorders, including
 increased lipotoxicity (fat accumulation) and dysregulation of lipid metabolism genes.
The gut-liver axis is impacted, resulting in
 intestinal dysbiosis, endotoxemia, and elevated stress hormones.
Vascular Endothelial Cells: Endothelial cells lose structural integrity, showing a marked reduction in cell stiffness/elasticity (up to 75% reduction observed in some tests) and significant loss of cytoskeletal components like actin. However, microgravity also
 increases nitric oxide (NO) production, which mediates blood vessel dilation.
Cardiovascular and Kidney Adaptation:
Cardiomyocytes derived from stem cells show enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium handling, and advanced structural maturation in microgravity, suggesting potential for regenerative cardiac therapies.
Kidney cells undergo metabolic reprogramming (reduced oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism) and tissue remodeling (overexpression of extracellular matrix genes) in response to human serum, regardless of gravity conditions.


Cancer Biology and Stem Cells
The microgravity environment provides a unique platform to study cancer cell behavior.
Tumor Modeling: Cancer cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs) readily form multicellular spheroids in microgravity, which closely mimic the 3D organization and physiological characteristics of tumors in vivo.
Therapeutic Susceptibility: Microgravity may enhance susceptibility to treatment in some cancer cells. CSCs exhibit
 increased apoptosis and a decrease in pluripotency markers, suggesting a shift toward differentiation.
Thyroid Cancer: Follicular thyroid cancer cells exposed to microgravity tend to adopt a less malignant phenotype.
Molecular Targets: Microgravity reduces the activity and nuclear localization of the transcriptional regulator YAP1, which is implicated in cell proliferation.

Bion-M 1 Mouse Mission Outcomes
The 30-day Bion-M 1 mission was a key effort to resume space biomedical research, with mice serving as the principal species.
Post-Flight Condition: Despite an extensive training program to socially house and diet-adapt the male mice, only 53% survived the mission. The surviving animals showed
 pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity, including impaired motor function and drastically reduced locomotor activity immediately post-flight.
Lesson Learned: The high mortality was likely due to the mice huddling near the feeder wall, potentially being injured by moving parts of the habitat, underscoring the need for improved housing designs in future missions.

                data-content="Microgravity conditions offer a powerful tool for improving the quality and function of therapeutic stem cells, specifically human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (hASCs).
Selective Proliferation: A novel technique using dynamic microgravity culture (stirred microspheres) was shown to selectively expand a highly functional subpopulation of hASCs known as Multilineage-differentiating Stress-Enduring (Muse) cells. These cells are characterized by the expression of the marker
 SSEA-3.
Enhanced Potency: Dynamic culture conditions produced a 4.4-fold proportional increase in SSEA-3(+) hASCs compared to standard culture dishes.
Improved Function: The hASCs expanded using this microgravity technique showed enhanced abilities for:
Proliferation and colony formation.
Angiogenesis (network formation).
Multilineage differentiation (adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic).
Molecular Preservation: These cells also maintained higher expression levels of crucial pluripotent markers, including OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, and KLF.
2. Bone Loss and Skeletal Degradation
Microgravity rapidly induces bone mass loss, affecting the major bone cell types through multiple pathways.
Multi-Cellular Mechanism: Bone loss is driven by three simultaneous processes:
Increased Osteoclast Activity: Enhanced bone-resorbing cell activity.
Osteocytic Osteolysis: Osteocytes (cells embedded in the bone matrix) actively degrade their surrounding matrix, evidenced by enlarged lacunae and significant up-regulation of the enzyme MMP10.
Inhibited Bone Formation: Osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) experience cell cycle arrest due to the substantial up-regulation of the inhibitor gene CDKN1a/p21.
Impact: A 15-day space mission in mice resulted in a measurable 6.29% decrease in Bone Volume Fraction (BV/TV) in the pelvic region.
3. Systemic Adaptation and Cellular Effects
Microgravity causes significant and widespread changes across various physiological systems and cell types.
Immune Dysfunction: The immune system is compromised, increasing the risk of infection.
T-Cells show suppressed activation and proliferation, leading to accelerated apoptosis.
Natural Killer (NK) cells and dendritic cells exhibit decreased function.
Cardiovascular and Endothelial Health:
Endothelial cells (lining blood vessels) lose structural integrity, showing a reduction in cell stiffness/elasticity and a loss of cytoskeletal components like actin.
Cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells) show beneficial effects, including enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and improved calcium handling, suggesting potential for regenerative cardiac therapies.
Metabolic and Organ Changes:
The liver can develop changes similar to metabolic disorders, including increased fat accumulation and dysregulation of lipid metabolism.
The gut-liver axis is affected, leading to
 intestinal dysbiosis.
Cancer and Tumor Modeling: Microgravity facilitates the formation of multicellular tumor spheroids that better mimic in vivo tumors. In some cancer cells, it can induce a
 less malignant phenotype and increase apoptosis in cancer stem cells. The microgravity environment also reduces the activity of the proliferation regulator,
 YAP1.
4. Organism-Level Adaptation (Bion-M 1 Mission)
The Bion-M 1 biosatellite mission showed the challenges and outcomes of a 30-day space flight using mice.
Goals: The mission aimed to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of adaptation to long-term microgravity exposure.
Post-Flight Condition: The surviving mice showed signs of pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity, including impaired motor function and severely reduced locomotor activity immediately after landing.
Survivorship and Lessons: Only 53% of the mice survived the mission. The high mortality was attributed not to aggression, but likely to the mice huddling near the feeder wall, risking injury from moving habitat parts. This finding emphasized the need for
 improved, animal-adapted habitat designs for future long-duration missions.

                data-content="One major barrier to autonomous space exploration is the inability to perform complex, real-time molecular diagnostics and gene expression analysis on-orbit. The
WetLab-2 system, validated on the International Space Station (ISS), addresses this by providing an end-to-end molecular biology laboratory capability in microgravity.
System and Function: WetLab-2 includes a novel fluidic RNA Sample Preparation Module (SPM), a centrifuge, and a real-time PCR thermal cycler (SmartCycler). The system uses all-in-one lyophilized reagents to isolate RNA and conduct
 multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) for gene expression analysis.
Validation Success: On-orbit experiments successfully extracted and analyzed RNA from frozen Escherichia coli cells and mouse liver tissue. The quantitative PCR (qPCR) results and efficiencies obtained on the ISS were
 similar to Earth (1g) controls.
Real-Time Data: The process for RNA isolation and multiplex analysis was successfully conducted in approximately 3 hours, with data transmitted to investigators within 2 hours of completion.
Adaptation: Initial thermal cycling in microgravity caused gas bubbles to be trapped in the assay tubes, but this issue was successfully suppressed using follow-up experiments that employed standard caps to pressurize the PCR tubes.
II. Bone Loss and Skeletal Degradation
Microgravity accelerates the loss of bone mass and structure through a complex interplay of degradation and inhibited formation.
Multi-Cellular Mechanism: Bone loss is driven by three simultaneous processes:
Increased Osteoclast Activity: Enhanced function of bone-resorbing cells.
Osteocytic Osteolysis: Osteocytes (the most abundant bone cells) actively degrade the surrounding matrix, evidenced by enlarged lacunae and the up-regulation of the matrix-degrading enzyme MMP10.
Inhibited Bone Formation: Osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) experience cell cycle arrest due to the substantial up-regulation of the inhibitor gene CDKN1a/p21.
Structural Impact: A 15-day space mission in mice resulted in a measurable 6.29% decrease in Bone Volume Fraction (BV/TV) in the pelvic region.
III. Advanced Stem Cell Culture and Regenerative Medicine
Microgravity conditions can be leveraged to enhance the functionality of therapeutic stem cells.
Selective Expansion: A dynamic microgravity culture technique was shown to selectively expand a highly functional subpopulation of human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (hASCs), resulting in a 4.4-fold proportional increase in the beneficial Multilineage-differentiating Stress-Enduring (Muse) cells (marked by SSEA-3).
Enhanced Potency: These microgravity-expanded hASCs maintained higher expression levels of key pluripotent markers (e.g., OCT4, SOX2) and showed improved capabilities for proliferation, angiogenesis, and multilineage differentiation.
IV. Systemic and Cellular Adaptation
Microgravity causes pervasive changes across multiple physiological systems, often compromising immune function and altering cellular structure.
Immune Dysfunction: The immune system is significantly compromised, characterized by:
Suppressed T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production.
Decreased cytotoxic activity in
 Natural Killer (NK) cells.
Disruption of critical signaling pathways like
 RAS, ERK, and NF-ÎºB.
Cardiovascular and Endothelial Health:
Vascular Endothelial cells lose structural integrity and show a marked reduction in cell stiffness/elasticity (up to 75%) and a loss of the actin cytoskeleton.
Paradoxically,
 Cardiomyocytes derived from stem cells show potential benefits, including enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and improved structural maturation in microgravity.
Cancer and Tumor Modeling: Microgravity facilitates the formation of multicellular tumor spheroids that better mimic the structure and physiology of in vivo tumors. It also appears to reduce the activity of the proliferation regulator
 YAP1 and can induce a less malignant phenotype in some cancer cells.
V. Organism-Level Adaptation (Bion-M 1 Mouse Mission)
The 30-day Russian Bion-M 1 biosatellite mission, a return to space biomedical research after 16 years, demonstrated the complexity of supporting animal life in space.
Outcome: The surviving mice showed pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity immediately post-flight, including impaired motor function and severely reduced locomotor activity.
Survivorship and Lessons: Only 53% of the mice survived the mission. High mortality was linked not to aggression, but likely to huddling near the feeder wall, causing injury from the habitat's moving parts. This highlighted the need for
 improved, animal-adapted habitat designs for future long-duration missions.

                data-content="Spaceflight induces molecular changes in the heart consistent with heightened stress and potential dysfunction.
Oxidative Stress: A 15-day space mission in mice caused gene expression changes that suggest persistent oxidative stress in heart tissue.
The pro-oxidative gene
 NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) was dramatically upregulated by 6.6-fold.
The master transcriptional regulator for oxidative defense,
 Nfe212 (Nrf2), was downregulated by 2.4-fold.
The gene
 Ptgs2, involved in reducing hydrogen peroxide, was downregulated by 3.4-fold, potentially leading to ROS accumulation and oxidative damage.
Cell Cycle and Proliferation: Genes related to cell cycle regulation and senescence were altered.
The potent cell cycle inhibitor
 Cdkn1a (p21) was substantially upregulated by 6.8-fold.
The inflammatory response gene
 Tnf was strongly downregulated by 9.9-fold.
Endothelial Cells: Microgravity compromises the structural integrity of vascular endothelial cells, leading to a significant reduction in cell stiffness/elasticity (up to 75%) and loss of the actin cytoskeleton.

2. Skeletal System and Bone Loss Mechanisms
Microgravity triggers rapid bone loss through complex, multi-cellular processes in the skeletal tissue.
Tripartite Mechanism of Loss: Bone loss is caused by three simultaneous effects:
Increased activity of
 osteoclasts (bone-resorbing cells).
Osteocytic Osteolysis: Osteocytes (bone-embedded cells) actively degrade the bone matrix, indicated by an increase in lacunar size and significant up-regulation of the matrix metalloproteinase MMP10.
Inhibited Bone Formation: Osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) experience cell cycle arrest, mediated by the substantial up-regulation of CDKN1a/p21.
Structural Impact: As little as 15 days of spaceflight led to a measurable 6.29% decrease in Bone Volume Fraction (BV/TV) in the pelvic region of mice.
3. Stem Cell Applications and Cancer Biology
Microgravity can be leveraged to enhance therapeutic stem cell properties and model disease.
Regenerative Medicine: Dynamic microgravity culture was shown to selectively expand a highly functional subpopulation of human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (hASCs), specifically the Multilineage-differentiating Stress-Enduring (Muse) cells.
This technique resulted in a
 4.4-fold proportional increase of SSEA-3(+) Muse cells.
The expanded cells demonstrated enhanced
 proliferation, angiogenesis, and multilineage differentiation capabilities.
Cancer Modeling: Microgravity facilitates the formation of multicellular tumor spheroids that structurally and physiologically better mimic in vivo tumors. This environment can also reduce the activity of the proliferation regulator
 YAP1 and induce a less malignant phenotype in some cancer cells.

4. Organism-Level Effects and Technological Enablers
Microgravity research requires dedicated technology and careful consideration of animal welfare.
Bion-M 1 Mission: The 30-day Bion-M 1 mouse biosatellite mission, a crucial step in resuming Russian space biomedical research, demonstrated the challenges of long-duration missions.
Post-flight mice showed
 pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity, including impaired motor function and severely reduced locomotor activity.
The mission suffered high mortality, with only
 53% survivorship. The deaths were attributed not to aggression, but likely to injury from the
 moving parts of the habitat as mice huddled near the feeder, highlighting the critical need for animal-adapted habitat designs.
On-Orbit Molecular Biology (WetLab-2): A novel, end-to-end system for RNA isolation and multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was validated on the International Space Station.
The WetLab-2 system successfully performed RNA isolation and multiplex gene expression analysis from biological samples (E. coli, mouse liver).
This technology enables
 real-time molecular diagnostics in space, with results and efficiencies comparable to Earth-based controls.

                data-content="Microgravity and radiation pose distinct, yet complementary, threats to skeletal health.
Microgravity-Induced Bone Loss
Microgravity triggers rapid bone loss through atripartite mechanism involving the major bone cell types:
Increased Osteoclast Activity: Enhanced function of bone-resorbing cells.
Osteocytic Osteolysis: Osteocytes (cells embedded in the bone matrix) actively degrade their surrounding matrix, evidenced by enlarged lacunae and the significant up-regulation of MMP10.
Inhibited Bone Formation: Osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) undergo cell cycle arrest due to the substantial up-regulation of the inhibitor gene CDKN1a/p21.
Structural Impact: A 15-day space mission in mice resulted in a 6.29% decrease in Bone Volume Fraction (BV/TV) in the pelvic region.
Space Radiation Effects
Total body irradiation (TBI) with space-like radiation causes dose- and ion-dependent damage, primarily affecting bone formation potential (osteoblastogenesis).
Persistent Damage: A high dose (200 cGy) of both low-LET protons and high-LET 56Fe ions caused persistent cancellous bone loss.
Inhibition of Bone Formation: Only high-LET 56Fe consistently and profoundly inhibited osteoblastogenesis (bone formation) by over 90%, with this impairment persisting for at least one year.
Oxidative Damage: High-LET 56Fe increased redox-related genes (Catalase, Gadd45) in marrow cells. While an antioxidant (
SOD) protected bone marrow cells from low-LET Î³-radiation, it failed to fully protect against the damaging effects of high-LET 56Fe. Both high-dose proton and
 56Fe radiation decreased the total antioxidant capacity of the bone marrow fluid by over 35% within one day of exposure.
2. Cardiovascular Health and Oxidative Stress
Cardiovascular systems show molecular signs of stress and altered function in space.
Heart Stress: A 15-day mission in mice resulted in gene expression changes consistent with persistent oxidative stress in heart tissue. Key changes included a
 6.6-fold up-regulation of the pro-oxidative gene Nox1, a 2.4-fold down-regulation of the master antioxidant regulator Nrf2, and a 6.8-fold up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn1a/p21.
Vascular Endothelium: Vascular endothelial cells lose structural integrity in microgravity, showing a marked reduction in cell stiffness/elasticity (up to 75%) and a loss of the actin cytoskeleton.
Cardiomyocyte Maturation: Conversely, studies using stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes suggest potential benefits, including enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and advanced structural maturation in microgravity.
3. Cellular, Immune, and Organ System Effects
Microgravity affects most biological systems, often compromising cellular defense mechanisms.
Immune Dysfunction: Microgravity severely compromises immune function, leading to suppressed T cell activation/proliferation and decreased cytotoxic activity of Natural Killer (NK) cells. These changes are linked to the disruption of critical signaling pathways like
 RAS, ERK, and NF-ÎºB.
Organ Metabolism: Microgravity can induce changes in the liver resembling metabolic disorders, such as increased lipotoxicity (fat accumulation). The gut-liver axis is also impacted, contributing to
 intestinal dysbiosis.
Cancer Biology: Microgravity facilitates the formation of multicellular tumor spheroids that better mimic the structure and physiology of in vivo tumors. This environment also tends to reduce the activity of the proliferation regulator
 YAP1 and can induce a less malignant phenotype in some cancer cells.
4. Spaceflight Technology and Missions
To facilitate autonomous deep-space exploration, new technology and operational protocols are required.
On-Orbit Molecular Diagnostics (WetLab-2): The WetLab-2 system was successfully validated on the ISS to provide an end-to-end molecular biology capability. This system performs automated
 RNA isolation and multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) on-orbit, allowing for real-time gene expression analysis from samples with results comparable to Earth controls.
Bion-M 1 Mission Lessons: The 30-day Bion-M 1 mouse mission, which resumed Russia's space biomedical research, had a high mortality rate (only 53% survivorship). The deaths were attributed not to aggression, but likely to injury caused by
 moving habitat parts as mice clustered near the feeder wall. Surviving mice showed
 pronounced post-flight disadaptation to Earth's gravity.
Regenerative Medicine: A dynamic microgravity culture technique was shown to selectively expand highly functional stem cells, resulting in a 4.4-fold proportional increase in Multilineage-differentiating Stress-Enduring (Muse) cells from human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (hASCs). These cells maintained higher pluripotency marker expression and exhibited enhanced differentiation capabilities.

                data-content="NASA views translational researchâ€”the bidirectional flow of knowledge between basic science, applied research, and medical operationsâ€”as essential to enabling Exploration Class missions beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO).
Translational Path: The strategy involves a two-phase approach:
Basic-to-Applied: The Space Biology (SB) program studies how life evolves and adapts in space using model organisms, cells, and tissues (Science exploring the unknown) This feeds into the
 Human Research Program (HRP).
Applied-to-Operational: The HRP identifies, characterizes, and mitigates risks to human health (Science addressing the known risks). Successful countermeasures are then implemented by
 Medical Operations.
Key Synergistic Research Areas (where SB and HRP overlap): Immunology, radiation/microgravity interactions, oxidative stress and damage, and the development of Artificial Gravity (AG).
Decadal Survey Recommendations: The National Academies recommended that animal research be firmly integrated into the space life sciences portfolio to drive knowledge translation.

2. Skeletal System Damage (Microgravity and Radiation)
The skeletal system is one of the most susceptible to the space environment, suffering both loss and impaired regeneration.
Tripartite Bone Loss Mechanism (Microgravity): Microgravity-induced bone loss is complex and rapid, affecting all three major bone cell types simultaneously:
Increased Osteoclast Activity (resorption).
Osteocytic Osteolysis: Osteocytes actively degrade the surrounding matrix, marked by enlarged lacunae and the up-regulation of the enzyme MMP10.
Inhibited Bone Formation: Osteoblasts undergo cell cycle arrest due to the substantial up-regulation of the inhibitor gene CDKN1a/p21.
Structural Impact: As little as 15 days of spaceflight resulted in a 6.29% decrease in Bone Volume Fraction (BV/TV) in the pelvic region of mice.
Space Radiation Effect: High-LET (linear energy transfer) radiation, such as 56Fe ions, causes persistent cancellous bone loss and profoundly inhibits osteoblastogenesis (bone formation) by over 90% for at least one year. Both proton and
 56Fe radiation decrease the bone marrow fluid's total antioxidant capacity.

3. Cardiovascular and Systemic Oxidative Stress
The heart and blood vessels show molecular signs of stress and altered function.
Cardiac Oxidative Stress: In a 15-day mission, mouse heart tissue showed gene expression changes indicating persistent oxidative stress. This included a
 6.6-fold up-regulation of Nox1 (pro-oxidative) and a 2.4-fold down-regulation of Nrf2 (antioxidant master regulator). The cell cycle inhibitor
 Cdkn1a/p21 was also upregulated by 6.8-fold.
Vascular Integrity: Vascular endothelial cells lose structural integrity and show a significant reduction in cell stiffness/elasticity (up to 75%), along with a loss of the actin cytoskeleton.
Immune System: Microgravity severely compromises immune function, suppressing T cell activation and proliferation, and decreasing the cytotoxic activity of Natural Killer (NK) cells. This increases the risk of infection and can lead to the reactivation of latent viruses in crewmembers.
Microbe-Host Interaction: Spaceflight can increase microbial virulence; an enteric pathogen (Salmonella typhimurium) demonstrated increased virulence in a mouse model following spaceflight.
4. Spaceflight Technology and Regenerative Medicine
New technology and research models are being developed to support long-duration missions and advance medicine on Earth.
On-Orbit Molecular Diagnostics: The WetLab-2 system was validated on the International Space Station (ISS) to provide an autonomous, end-to-end molecular biology capability. This system successfully performs
 RNA isolation and multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) with results comparable to Earth controls.
Advanced Stem Cell Culture: Dynamic microgravity culture can be used to selectively expand a highly functional subpopulation of human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (hASCs), specifically the Multilineage-differentiating Stress-Enduring (Muse) cells. This technique produced a
 4.4-fold proportional increase in Muse cells, which showed enhanced capabilities for angiogenesis and multilineage differentiation.
Organism-Level Challenges (Bion-M 1 Mission): The 30-day Bion-M 1 mouse mission demonstrated significant operational risks, with only 53% survivorship. Mortality was linked to injuries from the
 moving parts of the habitat as mice huddled near the feeder. Surviving mice exhibited
 pronounced post-flight disadaptation to Earth's gravity.

                data-title="The New High-Precision Method (KFEAâ€‹ method) (2018)"
                data-content="The researchers developed a precise method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse vertebral bodies (specifically L5 vertebrae). The method combines three key innovations:
Precise Specimen Preparation: 3D-printed support jigs are used for machining the tiny vertebrae to create plano-parallel surfaces, which ensures uniform contact with the loading platens.
Uniform Loading: The use of pivotable loading platens (spherically-seated) ensures uniform contact and loading of the specimen surfaces, which helps prevent unwanted scatter in mechanical response.
Strain Control: To achieve the same initial strain level for all specimens despite their natural heterogeneity, the method uses specimen-specific micro-CT-based Finite Element Analysis (KFEAâ€‹) to measure the stiffness. This calculated stiffness is then used to prescribe an
 individualized cyclic force (Fminâ€‹ and Fmaxâ€‹) that will result in the same specified level of strain for all test specimens.
Key Results and Conclusion
The new (KFEAâ€‹) method was compared against two existing literature methods (KEXPâ€‹ and FMAXâ€‹ methods).
Reduced Scatter in Fatigue Life: The new KFEAâ€‹ method significantly reduced the scatter of the mechanical behavior. Specifically, the standard deviation of the measured fatigue life was up to
 5-fold lower than the KEXPâ€‹ method and 2-fold lower than the FMAXâ€‹ method (F-ratio=4.9; p<0.01).
Uniform Fatigue Life: Unlike the literature methods, which showed a negative correlation between applied force and fatigue life, the new method's fatigue life was approximately uniform across all specimens, demonstrating successful strain control.
Stiffness and Fatigue Life: The KEXPâ€‹ method, which used a rigid platen design, resulted in significantly lower average elastic stiffness (Kelasticâ€‹) and lower average fatigue life compared to the KFEAâ€‹ and FMAXâ€‹ methods, highlighting the importance of the spherically-seated platen.
Consistency of Results: The strain-to-failure results (3.20Â±0.80%) were consistent with those reported for other species like human and bovine trabecular bone.
The paper concludes that this high-precision method produces
highly reproducible measurements of fatigue life, making it particularly valuable for studies with small sample sizes (e.g., in vivo animal experiments or space flight experiments) to improve the ability to detect small but statistically significant differences in bone quality associated with aging, disease, or treatment.

                data-title="Effects of ex vivo Ionizing Radiation on Collagen Structure and Whole-Bone Mechanical Properties of Mouse Vertebrae (2020)  "
                data-content="The study's main objective was to determine whether the degradation of bone mechanical properties due to ex vivo ionizing radiation is dominated by collagen fragmentation or the accumulation of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks (Advanced Glycation End-products or AGEs).
Specimens: Excised mouse lumbar vertebrae (L4 and L5) were used to study the effect of radiation on the bone material without the confounding influence of cellular activity.
Radiation Doses: Vertebrae were exposed to five different X-ray radiation doses: 0 (control), 50, 1,000, 17,000, and 35,000 Gy. This range spans clinically relevant doses from radiotherapy (
âˆ¼50 Gy) to allograft sterilization (âˆ¼30,000âˆ’35,000 Gy).
Testing: Specimens underwent monotonic compression (strength, ultimate strain) and cyclic compression (fatigue life) mechanical testing, alongside biochemical assays to measure non-enzymatic crosslinks (fluorescent AGEs) and collagen fragmentation (electrophoresis).
Key Results and Conclusion
The researchers found a clear dose-dependent threshold for mechanical degradation, which correlated strongly with collagen fragmentation, but not with non-enzymatic crosslinking.
Mechanical Properties
High Dose Effects (Sterilization Range): Monotonic strength, ultimate strain, and work-to-fracture were significantly reduced only at doses of 17,000 and 35,000 Gy.
Vertebral strength was reduced by
 50% at 17,000 Gy and 73% at 35,000 Gy compared to the control.
Monotonic stiffness remained unchanged across all doses.
Low Dose Effects (Radiotherapy Range): At 50 Gy and 1,000 Gy, there was no difference in monotonic strength, fatigue life, or other mechanical properties compared to the control.
Supplemental Findings (Cyclic Loading): A post-hoc study found that cyclic fatigue life was significantly reduced at doses as low as 5,000 Gy (18% lower than control), while monotonic strength was not yet affected. This suggests cyclic loading is a more sensitive test for radiation effects.
Biochemical Properties (Molecular Mechanism)
Collagen Fragmentation: Fragmentation of the collagen backbone, evidenced by fewer nominally sized collagen chains, was only observed at the high doses (17,000 and 35,000 Gy), coinciding with the loss of monotonic strength. Fragmentation was also evident at 5,000 Gy in the supplemental study, correlating with the loss of cyclic fatigue life at that dose.
Non-Enzymatic Crosslinks (AGEs): The amount of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks was greater for all radiation doses, increasing in a dose-dependent manner (e.g., nearly doubled at 1,000 Gy). However, this increase
 did not coincide with the observed reduction in mechanical strength at lower doses.
Primary Conclusion
The study concluded that the reduction in bone compressive monotonic strength and fatigue life due to ex vivo ionizing radiation is primarily caused by fragmentation of the collagen backbone, rather than the increases in non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks.
Clinical Implications
Allograft Sterilization: The finding that collagen fragmentation and mechanical loss (fatigue life) occur at doses as low as 5,000 Gy suggests that common allograft sterilization doses (e.g., 30,000Â±5,000 Gy) significantly compromise bone strength. The results emphasize the need for radioprotectants that specifically prevent or offset collagen fragmentation.
Radiation Therapy (In Vivo): Since no mechanical degradation was observed at the radiotherapy-relevant dose of 50 Gy ex vivo, the study infers that the increased fracture risk seen clinically in cancer patients after radiotherapy is not solely due to direct damage to the bone matrix, but is likely rooted in cellular processes of bone remodeling (in vivo effects).

                data-title="Absence of Î³-sarcoglycan alters the response of p70S6 kinase to mechanical perturbation in murine skeletal muscle(2014)"
                data-content="The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC), located at the muscle cell membrane (sarcolemma), is crucial for maintaining structural integrity. Mutations in the DGC proteins cause muscular dystrophies. Specifically, the loss of the Î³-sarcoglycan (a subcomplex of DGC) leads to severe myofiber degeneration, but surprisingly little susceptibility to contractile damage. This suggests that the disease mechanism may be due to aberrant signaling (loss of normal mechanotransduction) rather than purely structural deficits.
The study extended previous work on Î³-sarcoglycan's role in the mechanosensitive ERK1/2 phosphorylation pathway to examine other pathways.

Methods
The researchers examined mechanotransduction in C2C12 myotubes, primary muscle cultures, and isolated muscles from both wild-type (C57Bl/6) and Î³-sarcoglycan-null (Î³-SG$^{-/-}$) mice.
All muscle systems were subjected to cyclic passive stretch (mechanical perturbation).
The phosphorylation (activation) of key signaling proteins was determined by immunoblotting.
Key Findings
The study identified the p70S6 kinase (p70S6k) pathway as being significantly altered by the absence of Î³-sarcoglycan. The p70S6k is a major downstream effector in the mTOR (mammalian Target of Rapamycin) signaling pathway, which is critical for regulating muscle growth (hypertrophy) and protein synthesis.
Altered p70S6k Response: In wild-type (C57) muscles, cyclic stretch caused a rapid, transient increase in the phosphorylation of p70S6k (at Thr389 and Thr421/Ser424). However, in Î³-SG$^{-/-}$ muscles, the same mechanical stimulus caused no increase in p70S6k phosphorylation.
No Change in Upstream Signaling: The activation of Akt and mTOR, which are upstream components of the p70S6k pathway, was not altered by the absence of Î³-sarcoglycan. This indicates that the defect is specific to the Î³-sarcoglycan's role in regulating the connection between mTOR and p70S6k.
Myofiber Degeneration: The Î³-SG$^{-/-}$ mice displayed increased myofiber degeneration, which was associated with the lack of appropriate p70S6k activation after mechanical loading.
Conclusion and Significance
The absence of Î³-sarcoglycan causes a failure to activate the p70S6 kinase pathway in response to mechanical load. This finding suggests that Î³-sarcoglycan is essential for the mechanotransduction signal that links mechanical perturbation to the regulation of protein synthesis and muscle mass via p70S6k.
This provides a new molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of sarcoglycanopathy, suggesting that the muscle wasting is not simply a result of structural damage, but a failure of the muscle to properly sense and respond to mechanical stimuli necessary for repair and growth.

                data-title="5AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have overlapping functions in pollen development and pollen tube growth(2011)"
                data-content="Rab GTPases are crucial regulators of endomembrane trafficking, controlling processes like exocytosis, endocytosis, and membrane recycling in eukaryotic cells.
The Arabidopsis thaliana genome has 57 Rab GTPases, but only a subset have been functionally characterized.
AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c belong to the RabD subfamily, which are orthologs of the mammalian Rab1 isoforms known to regulate trafficking between the
 Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex.
The expression patterns of
 AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c transcripts are highly correlated (Pearson correlation of 77.81%), leading the researchers to hypothesize they have redundant functions not shared by other members of the RabD family.

Key Findings (Phenotypes)
Single Mutants: The single null mutants (AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c) showed no obvious morphological changes during vegetative growth, and their siliques (seed pods) and seed quantities were similar to wild-type plants. However, their pollen did exhibit some defects (about 10% irregular morphology, 20% swollen pollen tube tips), suggesting the remaining protein was sufficient to maintain fertility.
Double Mutant (AtrabD2b/2c):
Vegetative Growth: The double mutant was also indistinguishable from wild-type during vegetative growth.
Reproductive Defects: The double mutant displayed a striking phenotype associated with reproduction, specifically shorter siliques (about 70% of wild-type length).
Fertility: This reduced silique size was due to a seed fertilization defect, with approximately half of the ovules remaining unfertilized. Genetic crosses confirmed that the unfertilized ovaries were caused almost exclusively by defects in the
 pollen, not the female organ (ovary).
Pollen and Pollen Tube Defects:
The AtrabD2b/2c double mutant produced deformed pollen (over 20% irregular, collapsed, and sometimes lacking nuclei).
In in vitro germination tests, 10% of the double mutant pollen failed to germinate, and 50% of the germinated pollen failed to grow apically, resulting in shorter pollen tubes with swollen or branched tips.
The double mutant pollen also stained less intensely for starch.
Rescue: Introducing either the wild-type AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c gene into the double mutant successfully rescued the short silique and fertilization defects, confirming that the loss of these two genes was responsible for the phenotypes.

Conclusion
The findings confirm that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have partially redundant functions that are essential for pollen development and pollen tube growth. Their role is likely in vesicle trafficking during the rapid elongation phase of the pollen tube, a process that cannot be fully compensated for by the other members of the AtRabD family. Both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c proteins were found to localize to the Golgi bodies (or trans-Golgi).

Double Mutant: The double null mutant (AtrabD2b/2c) was also normal in vegetative growth, but displayed severe reproductive issues, notably shorter siliques (seed pods) with approximately 50% of ovules unfertilized.
Pollen Defect: This fertility defect was traced to the pollen. The double mutant produced a high percentage of deformed pollen and, critically, the germinated pollen tubes exhibited defective apical growth, resulting in shorter tubes with swollen or branched tips, which prevents successful fertilization.

                data-content="Novel Protein: AtGTLP was identified through its reported interaction with a trans-Golgi network (TGN)-localized Qa-SNARE protein, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 43 (SYP43).
Predicted Role: Based on its amino acid sequence similarity to metazoan fucosyltransferases (FUTs), AtGTLP is predicted to be a glycosyltransferase (GT). It is considered a member of a yet-uncharacterized family of
 Arabidopsis FUTs, as it showed no significant sequence similarity to previously identified Arabidopsis FUTs.
Structure: AtGTLP is a membrane-anchored protein with a type II-like topology. It has a single transmembrane helix and a globular domain in the C-terminus, which is predicted to reside in the lumen of the organelle.
Subcellular Localization
The primary goal of the study was to determine the subcellular localization of AtGTLP.
Primary Location: Colocalization experiments in Arabidopsis root cells using a GFP-tagged AtGTLP construct showed that the protein localizes primarily to the Golgi apparatus.
Specific Localization: The colocalization was highest with the trans-Golgi (ST-mRFP) marker (median Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) = 0.75), suggesting that a significant population of AtGTLP localizes to the trans-Golgi.
Specific Zones: Visual observation suggested that AtGTLP localizes to specific zones within the trans-Golgi, as patches of both AtGTLP-only and marker-only fluorescence were visible within the same structures.
Mutant Phenotype
Analysis of single T-DNA insertion mutants (atgtlp-/-) showed no obvious difference in vegetative phenotype compared to the wild type (measured by primary root length and fresh mass).
Conclusion: This lack of phenotype suggests that AtGTLP and other related proteins with high sequence similarity likely have redundant functions.

                data-title="TNO1, a TGN-localized SNARE-interacting protein, modulates root skewing in Arabidopsis thaliana(2017)"
                data-content="Protein Identification and Localization: The study characterized TNO1 (TGN-localized NOVEL protein 1, also known as TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), which is a putative tethering factor that localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in Arabidopsis thaliana. It was identified by its interaction with the TGN-localized SNARE protein, SYP41.
Role in Root Skewing:
Phenotype: The tno1 knockout mutant plants exhibited enhanced root skewing (the deviation of root growth from the vertical axis when growing on slanted medium) and increased epidermal cell file rotation compared to wild-type roots.
Mechanism: This phenotype suggests TNO1 plays a role in the directional growth and movement of the root.
Interaction with Cytoskeleton (Microtubules):
The researchers investigated the connection between TNO1 and the microtubule cytoskeleton, which is known to influence root cell expansion and orientation.
The enhanced skewing in tno1 roots was exaggerated when microtubules were stabilized, but was insensitive to microtubule destabilization.
Microtubule destabilization caused severe defects in cell morphology in the tno1 mutant, but not in the wild-type.
Crucially, the overall orientation of the microtubule arrays themselves remained unaffected in the mutant roots.
Conclusion: TNO1, a TGN-localized protein, modulates root skewing and cell file rotation. Its absence in the tno1 mutant appears to compromise the cell's ability to regulate or respond to changes in microtubule dynamics (likely by affecting cell wall deposition or cell expansion), which are essential processes for maintaining proper root growth directionality.

                data-content="The study identifies a critical role for the TNO1 (TGN-localized NOVEL protein 1) protein, a large coiled-coil protein localized to the Trans-Golgi Network (TGN), in regulating plant development and response to gravity through its involvement in auxin transport.
Protein Role and Localization: TNO1 associates with the membrane fusion protein SYP41 (a t-SNARE) and is hypothesized to function as a tethering factor, required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole.
Defects in the tno1 Mutant (Auxin-Related Phenotypes): The tno1 knockout mutant exhibits several defects linked to auxin transport and response:
Delayed Lateral Root (LR) Emergence: The density of emergent LRs was significantly lower in tno1 roots, although the number of initial LR primordia (initiation events) was normal, indicating a defect in the timing or process of emergence.
Decreased Gravitropic Bending: The mutant showed decreased gravitropic bending in both roots and hypocotyls upon gravistimulation.
Auxin Transport Delay: During gravistimulation, tno1 roots exhibited delayed auxin transport from the columella to the basal epidermal cells.
Reduced Auxin Asymmetry: The characteristic asymmetry of auxin response (visualized with a DR5rev:GFP marker) seen at the tips of elongating lateral roots and after gravistimulation was reduced or failed to display in the tno1 mutant.
Rescue and Mechanism:
Treating the tno1 mutant roots with exogenous auxins (1-NAA or IAA) successfully rescued the delayed LR emergence defect.
Bulk endocytosis to the TGN was unaffected in the mutant, indicating that the observed defects are not due to a general failure in membrane uptake.
Conclusion: The study demonstrates that TNO1 is essential for mediating auxin responses during root development and gravistimulation, likely by affecting the trafficking of auxin transport proteins (such as PIN or AUX/LAX transporters) which cycle through the TGN/endosome.

                data-content="Protein and Localization:
The protein studied is TNO1 (TGN-localized NOVEL protein 1, or TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein).
TNO1 is a putative tethering factor that is localized at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). It interacts with the SNARE protein SYP41.
Role in Root Movement (Skewing and CFR):
The tno1 knockout mutant plants exhibited enhanced root skewing (increased deviation from the vertical) compared to wild-type roots. The mutant displayed an exaggerated rightward skew.
The mutant also displayed enhanced epidermal cell file rotation (CFR), specifically a marked left-handed CFR.
The enhanced skewing and CFR suggest that TNO1 acts as a negative regulator of these root movements.
Relationship with Microtubules (MTs):
The role of TNO1 in root skewing is dependent on microtubules.
Skewing in tno1 roots increased upon microtubule stabilization (treatment with taxol) but was insensitive to microtubule destabilization (treatment with propyzamide).
Microtubule destabilization led to severe defects in cell morphology in the tno1 seedlings, suggesting TNO1 is required for maintaining cell shape.
Crucially, the orientation of microtubule arrays was found to be unaffected in the mutant roots.
Conclusion:
TNO1 modulates root skewing and cell file rotation in a mechanism that is dependent on microtubules but is not linked to the disruption of microtubule array orientation.
The study suggests that the TGN-localized SNARE machinery, which TNO1 is part of, is important for appropriate epidermal cell file rotation and cell expansion during root growth.

                data-content="Increased Survival: Exposure to hypergravity (4g) significantly increased post-infection survival in wild-type Drosophila and immune-response mutants when infected with the fungus B. bassiana. This suggests hypergravity boosts the host immune response.
Host Component Confirmed: Testing a gravitaxis mutant, yuri gagarin (yunz263), which has defective gravity sensing, showed that this mutant failed to exhibit the increased survival at hypergravity. This result confirmed that the improved survival effect is due to a significant host component (mechanosensing) and not just reduced fungal virulence.
Energy Stores: The increased survival was not correlated with changes in the flies' energy reserves (triglycerides, protein, or carbohydrates).
2. Effects of Microgravity (Spaceflight)
Experimental Setup: Flies developed from embryos to adults in microgravity (Âµg) aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery (the FIT experiment) and were tested upon return to Earth.
General Stress Response: Spaceflight alone, without infection, caused altered transcription, notably the activation of the heat shock stress system.
Toll Pathway Failure (Fungal Infection): Flies that developed in space, when subsequently infected with the fungus B. bassiana (which normally activates the Toll pathway), failed to activate the Toll pathway (as shown by transcription profiling).
Imd Pathway Normal (Bacterial Infection): In contrast, the same space-reared flies, when subsequently infected with the bacterium E. coli (which normally activates the Imd pathway), produced normal activation of the Imd pathway.
Opposing Effects: The study's major finding is that hypergravity and spaceflight have opposing effects on the immune system, with spaceflight resulting in a specific inability to mount a Toll-mediated infection response.
Conclusion
The study concludes that the innate immune system of Drosophila is highly sensitive to altered gravity. Development in microgravity (spaceflight) induces a stress response and leads to a specific dysfunction of the Toll signaling pathway (fungal immunity), while the Imd pathway (bacterial immunity) remains functional.

                data-content="Cardiovascular Risk Identified: The multi-omics analysis of mouse tissues exposed to radiation (including gamma, proton, and HZE particle radiation) revealed a consistent signal suggesting an impact on the cardiovascular system and oxidative stress.
FYN Kinase as a Central Hub: The study identified the non-receptor tyrosine kinase FYN as a central regulatory hub in the biological networks most impacted by space radiation. FYN is primarily known for its role in cellular signaling, including immune function, cell adhesion, and neuronal development, but also in cardiac injury and hypertrophy.
Proposed Mechanism (FYN Activation): The data suggests that space radiation (specifically the lower-LET types like gamma and protons) leads to:
Increased Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS): Activation of ROS-generating enzymes like NOX and inactivation of ROS-scavenging enzymes like CAT.
Oxidative Stress: The resulting oxidative stress leads to the inactivation of PTPs (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases).
FYN Activation: The inactivation of PTPs prevents them from removing phosphate groups from FYN, leading to its hyperactivation.
Long-Term Cardiovascular Impact: Chronic activation of FYN is hypothesized to mediate the long-term impact of space radiation on the heart, potentially contributing to cardiac fibrosis and cardiovascular disease risk observed in astronauts.
Methodology and Conclusion
Data Source: The researchers queried the GeneLab database, focusing on transcripts and protein expression in mouse tissues (primarily liver and brain) exposed to radiation.
Novelty: This study provides a mechanistic hypothesis, linking a master regulatory gene (FYN) to space radiation-induced cardiovascular risk, and demonstrates how NASA's GeneLab can be used for unbiased, multi-omics systems biology analysis.
The paper concludes that FYN activation, mediated by increased oxidative stress following space radiation exposure, is a likely pathway contributing to long-term cardiovascular risk in astronauts.

 reusability of metadata was frequently not well supported.
2. NASA GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS)
Mission: GeneLab (http://genelab.nasa.gov) is a NASA initiative to accelerate open science biomedical research relevant to space exploration and life on Earth. It hosts omics (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) data.
System Development Phases:
Phase I: Implemented the core data repository with systems for data submission, curation, indexing, search, and retrieval.
Phase II: Implemented federated search and retrieval capabilities, allowing users to query data hosted by GeneLab and three other extramural open-access omics data systems (GEO, EBI PRIDE, and ANL MG-RAST).
Phase III: Began deploying an omics data analysis platform (a Galaxy Server) where investigators can design, execute, and share in silico experiments and link their results back to the GLDS repository.
3. Proposed New Principles
Given the shortcomings in data interoperability found across the systems, the authors proposed two new principles for Big Data system developers to maximize data accessibility and usability:
Cost-efficient Metadata Acquisition: Acquiring rich metadata can be costly and challenging.
Integrated Credentialing: Streamlining authentication and authorization procedures across federated systems.

Distinct Biological Signatures: The analysis identified distinct biological signatures that associate specific types of radiation ions with specific biological responses.
Pathway Changes: The authors discovered changes in several fundamental cellular processes as a function of radiation dose, including:
Mitochondrial function.
Ribosomal assembly.
Immune pathways.
Dose Correlation: The study found that some pathways are related to unique aspects of GCR exposure (high energy, low dose, low dose rate), while others are universal responses to radiation.
Wound Healing/Tumorigenesis Link: A decrease in pathways related to wound healing and a corresponding decrease in common serum response (CSR) pathways were observed with increasing doses of space radiation. The authors suggest this decrease in wound healing, related to CSR, could potentially indicate an
 increased chance for tumor induction.
Conclusion
The article serves as a summary and demonstration of how the
GeneLab platform's rich database of omics experiments can be used to generate novel hypotheses to better understand human health risks, specifically from exposure to Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) during extended space missions. The complex radiation environment of space is a major risk factor, and GeneLab provides the necessary data for multi-omics analysis to address these challenges.

The analysis focused on miRNA expression in tissues such as plasma and heart.
Key Findings on Inflammation
The major finding relates to the role of these miRNAs in regulating inflammation during spaceflight, especially during the crucial landing phase:
Pro-inflammatory Increase: The study found an increase in pro-inflammatory miRNAs, specifically miR-145 and miR-146a, during the landing period.
Signaling Interaction: The interactions between the identified miRNA candidates and the signaling molecule TGF-Î²1 are highlighted as having important consequences for the inflammatory response.
Resolution: The paper also references miR-21, a miRNA involved in the resolution of inflammation.
Conclusion
The research provides a molecular basis for understanding the physiological changes that occur during space missions, pointing to a distinct miRNA signature that is particularly relevant to inflammation and cardiovascular health (in the context of related studies on space radiation and FYN activation). The identification of these specific circulating miRNAs reveals potential targets for developing pharmacological or nutritional countermeasures to mitigate health risks associated with space travel.

                data-content="Objective: To identify and characterize Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) genes in the ISS surface microbiome, which is a concern for long-duration space travel due to factors like microgravity and radiation.
Data Source: Shotgun metagenomics data from the Microbial Tracking-1 (MT-1) project, covering 21 metagenome sequences, 24 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), and 226 cultivable strains collected from eight different ISS locations over 12 months. Only data from viable microbes (treated with Propidium Monoazide, PMA) were used.
Algorithm: The study utilized a novel deep learning model (a machine learning algorithm) to analyze the data, allowing for the characterization of AMR genes beyond the traditional sequence similarity cut-offs.
Key Findings
High Prevalence of AMR Genes: The study confirmed the presence of a high number of AMR genes associated with the ISS surface microbiome.
Specific Resistance: The identified AMR genes confer resistance primarily to multidrug and metal efflux pumps, as well as resistance to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.
Core Species: The majority of the AMR genes were found in the two most abundant and persistent bacterial species on the ISS:
Staphylococcus epidermidis
Acinetobacter radioresistens
Novel Prediction: The deep learning model was able to predict a novel AMR gene for which no traditional reference was available.
Environmental vs. Clinical: The distribution of AMR genes on the ISS was found to be similar to that observed in other built environments and clinical settings, suggesting the transfer of resistance genes from human inhabitants to the ISS environment.
Conclusion
The research demonstrates that the ISS surface microbiome harbors a significant number of AMR genes and that machine learning is a powerful tool for characterizing these genes in complex, low-biomass environments like the ISS. The persistence of these resistance genes in dominant species like Staphylococcus and Acinetobacter highlights a potential health risk that needs to be monitored and managed for future space missions.

                data-content="The article reviews the available data to assess the potential risk of developing gynecological cancers in female astronauts due to the extreme conditions of the space environment. The primary risk factors discussed are:
Space Radiation: Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and Solar Particle Events (SPEs) pose a significant threat. The review notes that radiation, specifically the low-dose, low-dose-rate exposure typical of spaceflight, can induce DNA damage (including double-strand breaks), cause genomic instability, and alter epigenetic regulation, all of which are major drivers of cancer.
Altered Gravity (Microgravity): Microgravity is known to affect various cellular processes, including cell cycle, gene expression, and immune function, which could modulate the cancerous effects of radiation.
Key Findings and Mechanisms
The review summarizes the current understanding of how spaceflight conditions impact the risk factors for cancer:
Epigenetic Modifications: The paper highlights that ionizing radiation in space causes epigenetic changes (like alterations in DNA methylation and histone modifications). These changes can affect tumor-suppressor genes and oncogenes, contributing to carcinogenesis long after the radiation exposure.
Oxidative Stress: Spaceflight is associated with increased Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and oxidative stress. This stress is directly linked to DNA damage and chronic inflammation, both pro-carcinogenic conditions.
Immune Dysfunction: The space environment causes immune dysregulation (immunosuppression), which reduces the body's ability to identify and eliminate emerging tumor cells.
Gender-Specific Risk: While a direct link to increased gynecological cancer risk is difficult to establish definitively with current data, the review emphasizes that women have higher exposure to ionizing radiation in organs like the ovaries and breast compared to men, which are highly radiosensitive.
Conclusion and Countermeasures
The paper concludes that while there is no current evidence of increased cancer incidence in female astronauts, the theoretical risk based on cellular and molecular data (particularly from GeneLab and ground-based simulations) is real.
Mitigation Strategy: The review suggests that future research and countermeasure development must focus on epigenetic modulation and the use of radioprotectors that target the various steps of carcinogenesis, especially those that can prevent DNA damage or block the downstream effects of radiation-induced epigenetic and oxidative stress.

The study investigated how spaceflight and vaccination (tetanus toxoid, CpG adjuvant) affect antibody repertoire diversity in mice.


Methods
Data from four experiments, five datasets were analyzed.


Mice were either flown on the International Space Station (ISS) or subjected to a simulated microgravity model (AOS).


Antibody diversity was measured using Shannon index (SI) and rank-abundance curves.


Key Findings
Baseline repertoire: Normal spleen samples showed SI between 7.28â€“7.68.


Spaceflight: No significant reduction in diversity, but a trend toward lower SI in flown mice.


Simulated microgravity (AOS): No clear diversity loss compared to spaceflight.


Vaccination effects:


Spleen: TT and CpG had no significant effect on diversity.


Bone marrow: TT vaccination significantly reduced diversity.


Spleen vs. Bone marrow: Bone marrow repertoires were consistently less diverse.


Hypervaccination: Focused tetanus-specific response showed repertoire narrowing, but overall SI values remained similar to controls.


CDR3 usage: No consistent pattern across experiments. Individual repertoires were highly unique.

Estradiol levels remained unchanged across groups, while progesterone levels were lower in both flight and habitat control mice compared to baseline controls. Importantly, key genes involved in steroidogenesis and ovarian function showed no significant differences between spaceflight and control groups.
These results suggest that female mice maintain estrous cycles and ovarian activity during extended microgravity exposure, implying that fertility may be preserved. The study also emphasizes the importance of recording estrous cycle stage in future experiments involving female rodents in space. This research provides insights relevant to female astronaut health and long-term reproductive viability in space environment.

                data-content="Background: Abundant populations of bacteria have been observed on Mir and the International Space Station. While some experiments have shown that bacteria cultured during spaceflight exhibit a range of potentially troublesome characteristics, including increases in growth, antibiotic resistance and virulence, other studies have shown minimal differences when cells were cultured during spaceflight or on Earth. Although the final cell density of bacteria grown during spaceflight has been reported for several species, we are not yet able to predict how different microorganisms will respond to the microgravity environment. In order to build our understanding of how spaceflight affects bacterial final cell densities, additional studies are needed to determine whether the observed differences are due to varied methods, experimental conditions, or organism specific responses.
Results: Here, we have explored how phosphate concentration, carbon source, oxygen availability, and motility affect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in modified artificial urine media during spaceflight. We observed that P. aeruginosa grown during spaceflight exhibited increased final cell density relative to normal gravity controls when low concentrations of phosphate in the media were combined with decreased oxygen availability. In contrast, when the availability of either phosphate or oxygen was increased, no difference in final cell density was observed between spaceflight and normal gravity. Because motility has been suggested to affect how microbes respond to microgravity, we compared the growth of wild-type P. aeruginosa to a Î”motABCD mutant deficient in swimming motility. However, the final cell densities observed with the motility mutant were consistent with those observed with wild type for all conditions tested.
Conclusions: These results indicate that differences in bacterial final cell densities observed between spaceflight and normal gravity are due to an interplay between microgravity conditions and the availability of substrates essential for growth. Further, our results suggest that microbes grown under nutrient-limiting conditions are likely to reach higher cell densities under microgravity conditions than they would on Earth. Considering that the majority of bacteria inhabiting spacecrafts and space stations are likely to live under nutrient limitations, our findings highlight the need to explore the impact microgravity and other aspects of the spaceflight environment have on microbial growth and physiology.

                data-content=" Understanding how spaceflight affects microbial communities is vital for long-term manned missions, as surface-associated bacterial communities, known as biofilms, pose health and safety hazards, especially given the observed suppression of the immune system during spaceflight. While planktonic (free-floating) microbial cultures have shown increased growth and virulence in space, the effects on biofilm development were previously unclear.
Methods: To investigate this, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured during two Space Shuttle Atlantis missions (STS-132 and STS-135), and the resulting biofilms were characterized.
Results:
Spaceflight increased the number of viable cells, biofilm biomass, and thickness compared to normal gravity controls.
Biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a novel column-and-canopy structure that has not been observed on Earth.
The increased biofilm amount and novel architecture were independent of carbon source and phosphate concentrations in the media.
Flagella-driven motility was shown to be essential for the formation of this novel biofilm architecture during spaceflight.
Conclusion: These findings provide the first evidence that spaceflight affects the community-level behaviors of bacteria, leading to increased biofilm formation and the development of a unique architecture. This highlights the critical need to understand how microgravity and the spaceflight environment can alter both harmful and beneficial human-microbe interactions.

The goal of this standardization is to
eliminate data processing variation and enable easier meta-analysis across different spaceflight experiments, which often use different organisms and procedures.
The pipeline, known as the
RNA-seq Consensus Pipeline (RCP), includes three main, standardized steps:
Data Preprocessing (Quality Control & Trimming): Uses FastQC, MultiQC, and TrimGalore to remove sequencing adapters and low-quality bases from raw FASTQ files.
Data Processing (Mapping & Quantification): Maps trimmed reads to the reference genome and transcriptome using STAR, and then quantifies the number of reads per gene using RSEM.
Differential Gene Expression (DGE) Calculation: Uses the DESeq2 R package to detect differentially expressed genes and provides the results to users.
The data and results generated by this pipeline are
publicly available through the GeneLab database. The purpose of presenting the full details of this pipeline is to
promote transparency, reproducibility, and reusability of data, and to provide a template for processing future spaceflight-relevant datasets

Overall pathway analyses on the multi-omic datasets showed significant enrichment for
 mitochondrial processes.
Additional enriched pathways included innate immunity, chronic inflammation, cell cycle, circadian rhythm, and olfactory functions.
NASA's

Adverse health effects, such as bone demineralization and skeletal muscle atrophy, have been observed in space. To develop countermeasures for safe and effective crewed missions, scientists globally are conducting space omics studies. However, obtaining optimal scientific insight from this data requires improved standardization. In response, the
International Standards for Space Omics Processing (ISSOP) consortium was founded to enhance global guidelines for space biologists. This paper serves as an introductory reference to inform scientists about the challenges and future directions of space omics.
Summary
Space agencies are planning human missions to the Moon and Mars. The space environment poses stressors, including
radiation, microgravity, and isolation, that are crucial to understand for safe and effective crewed exploration. There is a critical need to develop countermeasures, adapt plants and microbes for life support, and limit pathogen infection.
Scientists are conducting space omics experiments on model organisms and humans. However, extracting actionable scientific discoveries from these datasets can only be achieved through
improved standardization. To address this, the
ISSOP consortium was established. ISSOP is an international group of scientists focused on enhancing standard guidelines between space biologists at a global level. The paper introduces the consortium and discusses lessons learned and future challenges in spaceflight omics

GeneLab provides an open-source repository of multi-omics data from real and simulated spaceflight studies to advance knowledge on physiological changes during space travel. However, this data alone can only identify biological changes and cannot infer the impact on an astronaut at the
phenotypic level (symptoms/diseases).
To bridge this gap, the
Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE) was used in combination with GeneLab transcriptomic data from six studies. SPOKE is a
heterogeneous knowledge graph that connects biological and clinical data from over 30 databases, including information on human biomedical data, patient symptoms, and drug side effects.
This integration enabled the comparison of space and terrestrial data, a capability previously missing. The results highlight new nodes within the graph, defining systems and effects relevant to space travel that would have been impossible to uncover without SPOKE. This integration specifically identified
critical symptoms and physiological changes incurred during spaceflight.
The findings suggest that
SPOKE can be used to gain a deeper biological understanding of the health hazards associated with spaceflight and serves as a proof of concept for its broader utilization in integrating space and terrestrial biological data.

Astrocyte activation and signs of immune dysfunction were also observed.
At the pathway level, some spaceflight-induced changes in the brain showed similarities with
neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by oxidative stress and protein misfolding.
This integrated spatial multiomics approach is a stepping stone toward understanding spaceflight-induced CNS impairments at the level of individual brain regions and cell types.

To better characterize these biological effects, this review compares gene expression datasets from microarray studies found in the NASA GeneLab, which is part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR).
In this review, the archived results for various tissues are summarized, with an emphasis on key genes that are highly reproducible across different mouse (Mus musculus) or human (Homo sapiens) experiments.
This exhaustive mining demonstrates the potential of NASA Open Science data to identify and validate mechanisms taking place when mammalian organisms are exposed to microgravity or other spaceflight conditions. The comparative meta-analysis highlights certain degrees of overlap and reproducibility in genes identified as differentially expressed within musculoskeletal tissues in each specific experiment.

                data-title="Dichotomous effects on lymphatic transport with loss of caveolae in mice(2021)"
                data-content="Fluid and macromolecule transport from the interstitium into and through lymphatic vessels is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis. While the structure of lymphatic capillaries suggests that passive, paracellular transport (between cells) is the main route for macromolecules to enter, active, caveolae-mediated transcellular transport (through cells) has also been identified in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in in vitro studies. Since caveolae are known to mediate a wide array of endothelial cell processes, including nitric oxide regulation, this study asks: How does the lack of caveolae impact lymphatic function
Methods
Various aspects of lymphatic function were assessed in vivo and ex vivo in mice lacking the protein Caveolin-1 in LECs (i.e., mice lacking caveolae). The study measured lymph transport, collecting vessel contractility, and the expression of genes and proteins related to lymphatic function.
Results
The results demonstrated a dichotomous (two-sided) effect from the loss of caveolae:
Impaired Collecting Vessel Function: The absence of Caveolin-1 led to decreased lymphatic muscle contractility, which resulted in reduced total lymph transport capacity.
Enhanced Capillary Uptake: Conversely, the loss of Caveolin-1 also caused a redistribution of the tight junction protein ZO-1, which in turn led to an increased passive uptake of macromolecules from the tissue into the lymphatic capillaries.
Conclusion
The findings reveal that Caveolin-1 and caveolae are essential for maintaining the contractile function of collecting lymphatic vessels by preserving the function of the smooth muscle layer. However, they simultaneously restrict macromolecule entry at the level of the lymphatic capillaries. This suggests that caveolae have dual and opposing regulatory roles in lymphatic fluid and macromolecule transport.

                data-content="Human-occupied built environments, including homes on Earth and the International Space Station (ISS), contain microbes, particularly fungi, which can grow when moisture levels are elevated. Understanding the indoor microbiomes in these unique environments is crucial as human space missions become more frequent (e.g., NASA's Artemis missions).
This study compared the bacterial and fungal communities found in dust collected from vacuum bags in Earth-based homes and on the ISS.
Key Findings
Diversity Difference: Bacterial and fungal communities were different in dust from Earth and the ISS. Earth-based homes were more diverse (465 fungal Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and 237 bacterial Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs)) compared to the ISS (102 fungal OTUs and 102 bacterial ASVs).
Moisture Effect: When dust from both locations was exposed to varying levels of equilibrium relative humidity (ERH), there were significant changes in fungal community composition as ERH and time increased.
ISS-Specific Fungi: Fungi found only on the ISS were less sensitive to ERH changes than those only found on Earth, suggesting a potential adaptation to the unique, less variable humidity conditions of the ISS.
The results suggest that different fungal communities have been selected for in space and their adaptation to humidity levels differs from Earth-based fungi. These findings are important for assessing the risks associated with microbial growth and potential crew health during long-duration space missions.

                data-content="The commercialization of space travel is leading to more people living and working in unique built environments like the International Space Station (ISS), which has its own indoor microbiome. As in buildings on Earth, elevated moisture (e.g., from a temporary ventilation system failure) in these closed spaces can cause unintended microbial growth, which poses risks to crew health and can degrade building materials. A predictive approach is needed to model this microbial growth.
Results
This study demonstrates that even short exposures to varying elevated relative humidity (RH) can facilitate rapid microbial growth and changes in microbial community composition in dust collected from spacecraft.
The researchers modeled fungal growth in ISS dust using the time-of-wetness framework, observing growth limited by activation and deactivation at 85% and 100% RH, respectively.
Fungal concentrations in the dust after the experiment reached an average of 4.4Ã—106 spore equivalents/mg of dust.
The study used Machine Learning models (Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) to successfully predict the fungal community composition based on the environmental conditions (RH and time).
Conclusion
This work provides a framework for predicting microbial growth and community composition in spacecraft environments by modeling the effect of moisture on dust. These models can be used to inform the design and operation of future space habitats to proactively prevent uncontrolled microbial growth and safeguard astronaut health.

(2012)"
                data-content="Bone loss associated with aging and menopause (estrogen deficiency) may be linked to vascular endothelial dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to determine if changes in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur are related to changes in trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) due to altered estrogen status in young (6 months) and old (24 months) female Fischer-344 rats.
Methods
Rats were divided into six groups: young intact, old intact, young ovariectomized (OVX, modeling menopause), old OVX, young OVX plus estrogen replacement (OVX+E2), and old OVX+E2. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the PNA was assessed in vitro using acetylcholine, and trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) was measured in the femoral neck.
Results
Estrogen Status Effect: OVX significantly reduced both PNA vasodilation and BV/TV in young rats, an effect that was reversed by estrogen replacement (OVX+E2).
Aging Effect: Aging (Old intact) was associated with a reduced PNA vasodilation, but not a reduction in BV/TV.
Combined Effects: The strongest negative correlation was found between PNA vasodilation and BV/TV in the groups where estrogen status was changed, but not in the old intact group.
Conclusion
The findings support the hypothesis that a loss of estrogen modifies the endothelium-dependent function of the PNA, and this change is associated with bone loss. This suggests a possible vascular-bone coupling mechanism that is dependent on estrogen status, which could be a novel target for therapeutics to combat age-related and post-menopausal bone loss.

(2013)"
                data-content="Chronic skeletal unloading (modeling the effects of microgravity or prolonged bed rest) is known to reduce hindlimb bone blood flow. This study aimed to determine:
Whether 7 and 14 days of hindlimb unloading (HU) in male rats alters femoral bone and marrow blood flow and vascular resistance during the initial period of reloading (10 minutes of standing).
Whether putative changes in bone perfusion are associated with gross structural remodeling of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur.
Methods
Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 7-day or 14-day HU or remained in weight-bearing control groups. Bone perfusion was measured following a 10-minute reloading period. Histomorphometry was used to determine the PNA's media wall thickness and maximal diameter. These data were then used to calculate arterial shear stress, vascular resistance, and wall-to-lumen ratio.
Results
PNA Remodeling: Both 7 and 14 days of HU resulted in significant PNA remodeling. This was characterized by a reduced PNA maximal diameter and an increased wall-to-lumen ratio.
Vascular Function: The structural remodeling was accompanied by increased calculated PNA vascular resistance.
Blood Flow: Consistent with the increased resistance, femoral bone and marrow blood flow remained significantly reduced during the 10-minute reloading period following both 7-day and 14-day HU.
Conclusion
The findings indicate that skeletal unloading induces rapid structural remodeling of the PNA (a reduction in maximal diameter and an increase in wall-to-lumen ratio), leading to a chronic increase in vascular resistance. This increase in resistance is a potential mechanism responsible for the impaired restoration of bone blood flow observed during the early stages of reloading, which may contribute to the bone loss (osteopenia) seen after spaceflight or bed rest.

This study aimed to determine whether chronic exercise training improves the distribution of bone and marrow blood flow in the hindlimb, both at rest and during exercise.
Methods
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups:
Exercise Trained (ET): Treadmill walking at 15 m/min up a 15âˆ˜ incline for 60 min/day over a 10â€“12 week period.
Sedentary (SED) Control: Acclimated to the treadmill for 5 min/day.
Blood flow to nine distinct regions of the femur, tibia, and fibula was measured at rest and during a low-intensity exercise bout (15 m/min walking).
Results
Resting Blood Flow: Exercise training did not significantly alter bone or marrow blood flow or vascular conductance at rest.
Exercising Blood Flow: During low-intensity exercise, the ET group demonstrated significantly greater blood flow to the distal metaphysis and epiphysis of the femur and the tibia compared to the SED group.
Vascular Conductance: This increase in blood flow was due to a greater increase in vascular conductance (lower resistance) in the ET group during exercise.
Conclusion
Chronic exercise training enhances the capacity of the vascular network serving the bone, resulting in augmented bone and marrow blood flow and vascular conductance during physical activity. This finding suggests that improvements in local vascular function may be an important mechanism by which exercise training exerts its beneficial effects on bone health.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the mechanisms controlling the blood vessels supplying the bone (skeletal vascular control) are altered during the progression of T2DM in the Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rat model.
Methods
The study examined the responses of the Principal Nutrient Artery (PNA) of the femur in obese ZDF rats at three stages: prediabetes (7 weeks old), short-term diabetes (13 weeks old), and long-term diabetes (20 weeks old). Vascular responses to both endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and endothelium-independent (sodium nitroprusside) dilators, as well as constrictors (phenylephrine), were measured. Additionally, femoral bone and marrow blood flow were measured in all groups.
Results
Vascular Dysfunction: Both short-term and long-term diabetes resulted in significant endothelial dysfunction in the PNA, shown by an impaired response to acetylcholine.
Arterial Constriction: The PNA also showed an increased sensitivity to phenylephrine, indicating heightened arterial constriction.
Reduced Blood Flow: Consistent with the observed vascular dysfunction, bone and marrow blood flow were significantly reduced in both diabetic groups compared to non-diabetic controls.
Conclusion
The findings demonstrate that the progression of T2DM leads to both functional and structural vascular impairment in the PNA, specifically causing endothelial dysfunction and increased arterial sensitivity to constrictors. This impaired vascular control is associated with chronic reductions in bone blood flow, suggesting that vascular dysfunction is a critical factor contributing to the impaired bone health observed in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes.

The primary purpose of this study was to determine if mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and other causes differed among three groups of astronauts:
Those who never flew in space (Non-flight).
Those who flew only in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).
Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans who have traveled beyond Earth's magnetosphere.
Findings
CVD Mortality: The CVD mortality rate among Apollo lunar astronauts (43%) was 4â€“5 times higher than in Non-flight (9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts.
Other Causes: There were no significant differences in mortality rates due to cancer or other causes among the three groups.
Mechanistic Investigation (Mice Study)
To investigate a possible mechanism, a secondary study was conducted on mice to determine the long-term effects of simulated deep space radiation (Iron-56 ions) combined with simulated weightlessness. The results demonstrated that:
Exposure to deep space radiation impaired the function of the vascular endothelium (the inner lining of blood vessels) and promoted the development of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).
Conclusion
The findings suggest that exposure to deep space radiation, experienced exclusively by the Apollo astronauts, is associated with an elevated risk of CVD mortality. This may be due to a mechanism involving the long-term impairment of vascular endothelial function caused by deep space radiation exposure.

Concerns have been raised regarding potential vision problems. This study investigates the effects of spaceflight on the retinaâ€”the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eyeâ€”using mice flown on the International Space Station (ISS) for 30 days during the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) mission.
Methods
Mice were studied under three conditions: Ground Control (GC), Spaceflight (SF), and Artificial Gravity in space (SF-AG) via a centrifuge. The retinas were analyzed using biochemical and proteomic (protein) techniques to identify molecular changes.
Results
Metabolic Stress: Spaceflight (SF) caused significant changes in metabolic processes in the retina, including alterations in creatine metabolism and the sirtuin signaling pathway (which regulates cellular stress and aging).
Oxidative Stress & DNA Repair: SF also led to an increase in oxidative stress and significant changes in proteins related to DNA repair and chromatin modification.
Artificial Gravity (SF-AG) Effect: Remarkably, the animals exposed to Artificial Gravity in space (SF-AG) showed a restoration of the majority of these molecular changes back toward Ground Control levels. The SF-AG condition successfully mitigated the adverse effects on creatine metabolism and DNA repair pathways observed in the SF group.
Conclusion
The findings indicate that microgravity is the primary driver of the observed molecular stress and damage in the mouse retina during spaceflight, leading to metabolic changes and DNA repair disruption. Importantly, this study provides strong evidence that Artificial Gravity serves as an effective countermeasure to protect the retina from spaceflight-induced molecular alterations.

                data-content="Microgravity, a key stressor during spaceflight, is known to cause cardiovascular issues, including a redistribution of blood flow and changes in vascular structure (remodeling) and 	function (neurovascular control). The purpose of this study was to examine how simulated microgravity (using hindlimb unloading, HU) affects the structure and neurovascular control of arteries supplying different tissuesâ€”specifically skeletal muscle and skin (cutaneous tissue)â€”in rats.
Methods
Male Wistar rats underwent 14 days of hindlimb unloading (HU). The study compared the effects on three different arteries:
Gastrocnemius artery (GA): A major artery supplying skeletal muscle.
Caudal cutaneous artery (CCA): An artery supplying skin.
Femoral artery (FA): A major artery used for comparison.
Arterial structure (wall thickness, wall-to-lumen ratio) and neurovascular control (response to norepinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (ACh)) were measured.
Results
The study found regionally distinct effects of simulated microgravity:
Skeletal Muscle Arteries (GA): The GA showed a severe structural remodeling (increased wall-to-lumen ratio) and a significant increase in sensitivity to norepinephrine (NE), indicating heightened vasoconstriction (narrowing) and impaired neurovascular control.
Cutaneous Arteries (CCA): In contrast, the CCA showed no significant structural remodeling or change in its contractile response to NE.
Endothelial Function: Endothelium-dependent vasodilation (response to ACh) was impaired in both the GA and the CCA.
Conclusion
Simulated microgravity induces region-specific vascular remodeling and neurovascular dysfunction, particularly in arteries supplying skeletal muscle (GA), while skin-supplying arteries (CCA) are mainly affected by endothelial dysfunction. This suggests that the observed changes in blood distribution following spaceflight are driven by tissue-specific vascular adaptations, where the skeletal muscle vasculature becomes hyper-reactive and structurally rigid.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7339929/

                data-content="This study investigated the transcriptional response of the liver and quadriceps muscle of mice after 37 days of spaceflight (NASA RR1 mission) to understand the molecular mechanisms behind spaceflight-induced physiological changes, particularly muscle atrophy. The key finding is that muscle atrophy is a paired event with impaired lipid metabolism in the liver, suggesting a crucial metabolic communication between the two organs during spaceflight.
Key Metabolic Crosstalk and Gene Expression Changes:
Lipid Metabolism is Most Affected: Lipid metabolism was the most commonly affected biological process in both the liver and the quadriceps muscle. Genes related to lipid metabolism were among the most affected differentially expressed genes (DEG) in both tissues.
Specific lipid metabolism pathways, including Î²-oxidation lipid and triglyceride biosynthetic pathways, were upregulated in both organs.
A specific liver lipid gene cluster expression pattern strongly correlated with the expression of genes in the muscle.
Muscle Shift to Energy-Saving Mode: The muscle displayed a signature consistent with an energy-saving or starvation-like phenotype.
Hypoglycemic signaling pathways (including Insulin, PI3K-Akt, AMPK, FoxO, and ErbB) were among the most significantly downregulated pathways in the quadriceps muscle.
This downregulation led to decreased glucose transport process gene expression.
This decreased energy intake was correlated with a transcriptional shift away from high energy demand processes in the muscle, such as DNA repair, autophagy, and translation gene expression, which were also decreased in flight mice.
The Liver-Muscle Link: A strong correlation was found between the impaired lipid metabolism gene expression in the liver and the muscle atrophy phenotype gene expression. This correlation suggests the liver may be signaling to the muscle to initiate a glucose-sparing energy-saving response. The researchers hypothesize that hepatokines (proteins secreted by the liver) are the likely effectors of this organ communication.
Conclusion and Countermeasure:
The results indicate that spaceflight induces a starvation-like phenotype involving a metabolic shift and resource sparring through a tight liver-muscle crosstalk.
The authors propose that dietary changes may represent a possible countermeasure to spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy. Specifically, they highlight that butyrate and propanoate metabolism (short-chain fatty acids) were highly affected, and that butyrate supplementation or dietary modification to stimulate microbial production could counteract muscle atrophy, prevent insulin resistance, and diminish lipid accumulation during spaceflight.

Key Findings on Radiation Type and Effect:
Distinct Effects by Particle: The high-Linear Energy Transfer (LET) particles from GCR caused different and persistent effects on DNA methylation compared to lower-LET radiation.
Iron Ions (Fe): Primarily induced a persistent increase in DNA methylation (hypermethylation). The effect of Fe was observed on both previously hypomethylated and hypermethylated sites.
Silicon Ions (Si): Primarily induced a decrease in DNA methylation (hypomethylation), but this decrease was not persistent over time.
X-ray (Low-LET): Induced a decrease in DNA methylation, which was not persistent.
Location of Damage: Regardless of the radiation type, the resulting Differentially Methylated Probes (DMPs) were found to be primarily located in active regulatory regions, specifically promoter regions and CpG islands. This suggests that active gene control regions are more vulnerable to radiation-induced epigenetic changes.
Influence of Nuclear Architecture:
The study divided the cell nucleus into five radial layers (L1, L2... L5, from outer to inner) based on chromatin conformation data (Hi-C) to determine the effect of physical positioning.
DMP Frequency: The highest frequency of DMPs (total number of changes) was observed in the outer layers (L1 and L2) of the nucleus for all radiation types. This suggests that the outer layers absorb the initial and highest radiation dose.
Methylation Change Intensity: Interestingly, the absolute mean DNA methylation change (the magnitude of the change) peaked around the middle layer (L3). This suggests that while the outer layers have the most sites affected, other factors may limit the magnitude of the change there, and the damage may be more functionally significant deeper inside the nucleus.
Persistence by Layer: The strong methylation change induced by Fe persisted all the way to the deepest layer (L5), while the effect of Si and X-ray was limited and had the lowest change in the deepest layer.


Role of Epigenetic Marks (Histone Modifications):
The research explored the role of histone modifications that mark active (Euchromatin) or repressive (Heterochromatin) DNA regions.
The probability of a DMP occurring was found to decrease in active regions (H3K27ac) and increase in repressive regions (H3K9me3) from the outer to the inner layers.
DMPs were more likely to be found in all four examined histone marks (active and repressive) compared to all DMPs genome-wide, suggesting that regulatory elements with histone marks are generally more susceptible to methylation changes from radiation.

"
                data-content="1.Metabolic Adaptations
SARS-CoV-2 infection causes major shifts in cellular metabolic pathways, leading to systemic effects:
Mitochondrial Dysfunction: Infection leads to decreased mitochondrial function and inhibition of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway.
Glucose Metabolism: There is an increased reliance on glycolysis and shunting toward the pentose 5 phosphate pathway. Serum levels of metabolites from the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle (like citrate, fumarate, malate, and aconitate) are significantly lower in COVID-19 patients.
Lipid Metabolism: Infection alters lipid metabolism and circulating lipid levels. Increases in triglycerides and free fatty acids (e.g., arachidonic acid and oleic acid) correlate with disease severity. Overall, the body appears to shift toward a physiological
 catabolic state.

2.Humoral (Circulating Factor) Changes
Changes in circulating compounds lead to systemic pathophysiology:
Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Imbalance: SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor and directly interacts with the RAS . In COVID-19 patients, this leads to an imbalance, characterized by elevated levels of ACE2, renin, angiotensin, and
 bradykinin. Elevated bradykinin levels are associated with cardiovascular symptoms, inflammation, coagulation, and lymphopenia.
Endocrine System Damage: The ACE2 receptor is expressed on various endocrine glands. Infection can cause reduced function in the thyroid (e.g., subacute thyroiditis), adrenals (e.g., hypocortisolism), and pancreas (e.g., hyperglycemia, pancreatic injury).

3.Exosomes and Intercellular Communication
Exosomes, which are extracellular vesicles, act as vectors for viral material and messengers of cellular state:
Biomarkers and Immunity: Exosomes from severe COVID-19 patients were associated with increased and chronic inflammation, while those from mild patients correlated with a normally functioning immune system and could stimulate a T-cell response.
Systemic Damage: Exosomes derived from the plasma of severe patients can affect endothelial cells by inducing inflammation-related pathways (e.g.,NRLP3,caspase-1).
Antiviral Role: Exosomes containing high levels of the viral receptor ACE2 can be released to bind and block viral entry, suggesting a role in the antiviral response.
4.Non-Coding Transcriptome (ncRNAs)
Various types of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) regulate the viral cycle and host antiviral responses (See Figure 1 in the original document):
MicroRNAs (miRNAs): These short regulatory RNAs are altered in circulation and can serve as prognostic biomarkers. For example, the elevated
 miR-2392 is linked to the suppression of mitochondrial gene expression (OXPHOS) and inflammation.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs): Infection induces changes in lncRNAs, some of which are involved in immune-related pathways and viral replication processes (e.g., LASI, NRIR, BISPR).
Circular RNAs (circRNAs): Changes in circRNA expression upon infection are mainly found in genes involved with inflammation and immune responses.
5.Cardiovascular Adaptations
The cardiovascular system transports the virus throughout the body and undergoes significant damage:
Myocardial Injury: Autopsy studies show the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in myocardial tissue and decreased expression of heart functional markers (e.g., TNNI3, TNNT2).
Endotheliitis and Thrombosis: Histopathological evidence shows direct viral infection of endothelial cells and micro- and macrovascular thrombosis in both arterial and venous circulations. This damage leads to endothelial activation, hypercoagulability, and inflammation.
Complications: Diverse cardiovascular complications include myocardial injury, heart failure, micro-embolic infarcts, acute coronary syndrome, and arrhythmias. Elevated Troponin I is a common clinical marker for myocardial injury in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and increases with disease severity.

"
                data-content="This study investigated the molecular changes induced by spaceflight, hypothesizing that they lead to transcriptomic signatures related to aging, frailty, and sarcopenia. The researchers analyzed multi-omics data from murine models (rodents flown on the ISS) and human astronaut data (JAXA and the Inspiration4 missions). The core finding is that spaceflight induces changes in gene expression and pathways consistent with an early frailty-like condition.
Key Connections Between Spaceflight and Aging/Frailty:
Spaceflight as Accelerated Aging: Molecular changes seen during space exploration such as genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and epigenomic changes share striking similarities with the hallmarks of aging on Earth.
Frailty and Sarcopenia: Frailty is a geriatric syndrome defined by a depletion of physiological reserve and vulnerability to stressors. Sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass and strength) is a major feature of aging and frailty. The study proposes that muscle loss in astronauts is a sarcopenia-like syndrome.
A Frailty Phenotype The findings suggest that exposure to the space environment leads to changes consistent with frailty, including inflammation, muscle wasting, and other age-related features. The study identified notable changes in gene expression that may be indicative of the development of a frailty-like condition during space missions.
Molecular Evidence in Rodent and Human Samples:
Rodent Muscle Atrophy and Frailty Genes:
Analysis of various mouse skeletal muscles (gastrocnemius, extensor digitorum longus (EDL), quadriceps, soleus, tibialis anterior) on the ISS showed altered expression of putative frailty biomarker genes.
There was a general bias toward the up-regulation of frailty-related genes.
The soleus muscle (which is severely impacted by spaceflight) showed an increase in the innate immune response inflammatory signature and a corresponding downregulation of the IGF-1 pathway (an anabolic/growth factor). This immune-related response may promote muscle wasting.
Human Astronaut Gene Expression (JAXA & Inspiration4):
Inflammatory Pathways: Interferon alpha and gamma response pathways (markers of inflammation) were consistently upregulated in all human datasets investigated, aligning with the chronic low-grade inflammation often associated with frailty (inflammaging).
Non-Reverting Genes: Expression of several frailty-related genes did not return to baseline after astronauts' return to Earth, challenging the idea that all physiological changes induced by spaceflight are transient. For example, the gene AKT1 was persistently upregulated after re-entry, which is linked to age-related cardiac disease and dementia in animal models.
Short-Duration Flight (Inspiration4): Single-cell data from the 3-day Inspiration4 mission showed that frailty genes in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were increased immediately post-flight (R+1) compared to pre-flight and returned to baseline over time.
Conclusion and Recommendation:
The results indicate that spaceflight induces molecular changes consistent with the development of frailty. The authors conclude that further investigation is warranted to explore the utility of a frailty index in monitoring astronaut health. This research is key for developing countermeasures for long-duration missions (like a mission to Mars) and could also help inform therapies for aging patients on Earth.

"
                data-content="This study investigated a countermeasure to mitigate the profound health damage, particularly cardiovascular damage, caused by Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR) during deep space missions. The research demonstrates that inhibiting three specific microRNAs (miRNAs) can effectively rescue cells from radiation-induced damage.
Methodology and Key Targets
The researchers used 3D human microvessel cell cultures to simulate cardiovascular damage from GCR. They focused on three specific miRNAsâ€”miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5pâ€”previously identified as being altered by spaceflight. The countermeasure involved applying antagomirs (miRNA antagonists) to block the function of these three miRNAs. The combined antagomir treatment proved more effective than inhibiting individual miRNAs. The relevance of these targets was confirmed using multi-omic data from human astronauts, including the NASA Twin Study, the JAXA mission, and the Inspiration4 civilian flight.
Key Rescue Effects by Antagomirs
The inhibition of the three miRNAs resulted in the rescue of several critical cellular and physiological functions, reversing the effects of simulated GCR:
Vascular Structure and Function: The antagomir treatment prevented microvessel collapse and rescued the inhibition of angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation) caused by GCR exposure.
DNA Damage Repair: The antagomirs significantly reduced the activity of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The number of 53BP1 DNA repair foci (a marker for DSBs) was decreased to levels similar to un-irradiated control cells, suggesting a more efficient DNA repair mechanism.
Mitochondrial Function: The treatment restored normal mitochondrial functions. This was evidenced by the rescue of the Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway, which had been downregulated by GCR-induced stress.
Inflammation: A significant reduction of inflammation was observed. The treatment reversed the GCR-induced activation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as TP53, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and TNF-alpha signaling.
Gene Expression: Global RNA-sequencing analysis showed that the antagomir-treated cells clustered closer to the unirradiated control cells, demonstrating that the treatment had a substantial impact on restoring gene expression back to normal levels.
Conclusion and Significance
The findings validate the use of these three spaceflight-associated miRNAs as molecular targets for countermeasure development. The study proposes that this antagomir strategy can be utilized by astronauts during space missions to directly mitigate space radiation damage and reduce associated health risks, particularly in the cardiovascular system.

"
                data-content="The article addresses the growing ethical, legal, and medical policy concerns arising from the rapid rise of commercial and private-sector crewed space exploration. This new era involves a diverse group of non-professional space travelers, termed Spaceflight Occupants (SOs), for whom existing regulations and medical oversight are minimal compared to those for government astronauts.
The Dangers of Space and Health Consequences
Spaceflight poses significant health risks (known as the Five Hazards), including:
Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and other radiation.
Changing gravity fields.
Isolation and confinement in a hostile, closed environment.
Distance from Earth.
These hazards lead to a range of serious molecular and physiological consequences, such as DNA damage, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysregulation, and epigenetic changes. The systemic health effects include cardiovascular changes (e.g., fluid shifts, thrombus formation), musculoskeletal loss (atrophy and bone loss), and immune system dysfunction.
Core Ethical Concerns: Selection and Oversight
The key ethical problem is the differential standard between government and private space travel:
Lax Private Sector Selection: Professional astronaut selection (by agencies like NASA, ESA, and JAXA) is highly stringent. In contrast, the clearance of private SOs is generally the responsibility of commercial providers with limited governmental oversight and a lack of standardized screening.
Weak Regulation: Current international legal frameworks (e.g., UN Space Treaties) and national guidance (e.g., US Federal Aviation Administration or FAA) do not explicitly regulate the health of private space travelers. The FAA's guidance consists of minimal recommendations that only cover launch and re-entry and explicitly state that they do not include specific medical criteria to limit who can fly.
Risk of Medical Forum Shopping: The lack of standardized medical protocols creates a risk that SOs who are disqualified by one physician may seek clearance from a more lenient provider (medical forum shopping), potentially endangering themselves and others.
Endangering Others: The compromised health of one SO in the confined, resource-limited space environment can pose a risk to fellow passengers and crew, especially since providing medical assistance in space is highly challenging.
Ethical Issues in Human Subject Research
The increase in commercial missions offers an opportunity to collect vital health data, but this necessitates strict regulation.
Government Standards: Agencies like NASA have strict research ethics policies, including the use of Institutional Review Boards (IRB), a requirement for a favorable risk/benefit analysis, and a mandate for the flight surgeon to intervene and terminate research if an astronauts health is at risk.
The Regulatory Gap: The major challenge is applying these robust ethical frameworks to non-governmental and civilian SOs who may participate in research. Furthermore, studies involving genetic testing are categorized as greater than minimal risk by NASA and require the highest level of protection, including strict rules for data storage and non-release without explicit approval.

"
                data-content="This study investigated how the opportunistic pathogen
Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) is affected by the space environment, particularly microgravity, and whether this impacts the outcome of an infection in a host model, the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster).
The core finding is that both
true spaceflight and simulated microgravity (SMG) conditions increase the virulence (lethality) of S. marcescens to its host.
Key Results:
Increased Lethality in Space-Grown Bacteria:
S. marcescens grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) was significantly more lethal to D. melanogaster compared to ground-based control bacteria.
This increased virulence was also observed in bacteria grown in
 Simulated Microgravity (SMG) conditions using a Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) apparatus on Earth, suggesting that microgravity is a key factor mediating this change.
Increased Bacterial Growth Rate:
The space-flown bacteria exhibited
 altered growth kinetics within the host, showing a significantly higher growth rate at later time points (12 hours and 15 hours post-injection) compared to ground control bacteria.
Temporary, Physiological Change:
The increased virulence was determined to be a
 temporary, physiological change in the bacteria, not a permanent, heritable genetic change (e.g., from radiation).
When the space-flown
 S. marcescens samples were returned to normal Earth gravity and subcultured overnight, the increased virulence disappeared (the fly survival rate became similar to ground controls).
Host Immune System Not the Primary Factor:
To determine if the pathogen was simply weakening the host's immune system, the researchers infected mutant flies with compromised immune pathways (
Imd and Toll pathways).
Space-flown bacteria still caused
 greater lethality in both wild-type flies and the immune-compromised mutants compared to ground-grown bacteria.
RNA sequencing analysis further showed only
 minimal changes in the expression of host immune-related genes when infected with space-flown versus ground-grown bacteria.
These findings suggest that the increased lethality is primarily due to a
 change in the bacteria's physiology that makes it more virulent, rather than a significant change in the host's ability to respond to the infection.
In conclusion, the study demonstrates that exposure to spaceflight conditions induces a
reversible physiological change in Serratia marcescens that results in a more lethal infection in its host, with microgravity being the likely principal factor.

"
                data-content="This study utilized the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) cardiac model to investigate the effects of prolonged microgravity exposure (30 days aboard the International Space Station or ISS) on heart structure and function. The key finding is that lifelong exposure to microgravity causes cardiac dysfunction and structural remodeling, characterized by reduced contractility, compromised heart size, and significant changes at the molecular and protein level, which is a fundamental response of the heart muscle.
Key Physiological and Functional Changes:
Reduced Cardiac Contractility: Hearts from flies reared in microgravity (Space-Flown or SF) showed significant decreases in fractional shortening (a measure of contractility).
Cardiac Constriction and Output: Female SF flies showed a significant reduction in end-diastolic diameters (EDDs) and a
 highly significant reduction in cardiac output , indicating compromised, smaller hearts.
Arrhythmia: Male SF flies showed significantly increased cardiac arrhythmia (beat-to-beat variability).
Structural Remodeling: The heart's internal structure was altered:
Myofibrillar Disarray: The myofibrils (the contracting units of muscle cells) were loosely arranged, with gaps, and exhibited a more longitudinal (instead of circumferential) orientation compared to ground controls. This remodeling leads to the heart generating less force.
Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Loss: The stabilizing collagen network (specifically pericardin, the fly's collagen IV homolog) surrounding the heart was significantly reduced in SF female hearts. This is an unexpected result, as heart dysfunction often leads to increased collagen (fibrosis).
Molecular (RNA-seq) and Protein Changes (Proteostasis):
Proteasomal Stress: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed a dramatically increased proteasomal gene expression in SF hearts.
Ontological analysis showed a
 ~20-fold enrichment in genes related to proteasome-mediated ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent protein catabolism (protein breakdown).
Follow-up analysis on a second flight confirmed
 dramatically elevated proteasome aggregates co-localizing with increased amyloid and polyQ deposits. This suggests
 abnormal proteostasis (protein maintenance and degradation).
Downregulated Pathways: The heart showed reduced expression of sarcomeric/ECM genes. Genes related to
 carbohydrate metabolic processes and the Extracellular Matrix (ECM) were significantly downregulated.
Findings in Mutant Flies:
Increased Severity in Mutants: Flies with a mutation in the seizure (sei) gene (the Drosophila homolog of the human hERG gene, which causes Long QT Syndrome in humans) experienced
 more severe cardiac remodeling in response to microgravity. This suggests that genetic predispositions to cardiac issues are exacerbated by spaceflight.
Proteostasis Stress is Fundamental: In the sei/hERG mutants, proteasomal gene expression was still increased in microgravity compared to their ground controls , suggesting that cardiac remodeling and
 proteostatic stress is a fundamental response of heart muscle to microgravity across genotypes.

Drosophila and Human Relevance: The study utilizes the Drosophila heart because its structure and function are fundamentally conserved from flies to humans , making it an effective model to examine microgravity's effects.

"
                data-content="This review focuses on the central and multifaceted role of the actin cytoskeleton in regulating the primary root growth of plants, particularly how it orchestrates cell elongation, division, and the response to gravity (gravitropism). The actin cytoskeleton is a dynamic network of filaments that dictates the direction and speed of cell expansion.
1. Actin and Cell Expansion/Elongation
Directionality: Actin filaments are crucial for establishing and maintaining the anisotropy (directional growth) of root cells.
They are thought to guide the deposition of cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall, which in turn determines the direction in which the cell expands.
The Bundled Actin (BA) populationâ€”long, thick cables of actinâ€”is closely associated with the plasma membrane and is likely responsible for determining the direction of the underlying cortical microtubule arrays, which regulate cell wall deposition.
Speed: Actin dynamics directly influence the speed of cell expansion by controlling the transport of vesicles carrying cell wall material and proteins to the plasma membrane.
Treatments that disrupt or stabilize the actin cytoskeleton dramatically inhibit or alter root growth.
2. Actin in Gravitropism (Gravity Sensing)
Statolith Sedimentation: The actin cytoskeleton forms a delicate network around the amyloplasts (starch-filled organelles) in the root cap's gravity-sensing cells (statocytes).
This network is essential for the amyloplasts, which act as statoliths (gravity sensors), to settle correctly at the bottom of the cell in response to gravity.
The movement and sedimentation of the statoliths trigger the signaling cascade for the root to curve and grow downwards.
Auxin Transport: Actin is intimately involved in regulating the polar transport of auxin, the plant hormone that controls gravitropic curvature.
In the root cap, the movement and recycling of PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins (auxin efflux carriers) are guided by the actin network.
This guidance ensures that auxin is redistributed to the lower side of the root, where it inhibits cell elongation, causing the root to bend downwards.
3. Actin-Associated Proteins (AAPs)
The various functions of actin are managed by a host of Actin-Associated Proteins (AAPs) that organize the network:
Bundling/Cross-linking: AAPs like Villin and Fimbrin are responsible for cross-linking and bundling the individual actin filaments into thicker cables (Bundled Actin or BA). This bundling activity is crucial for the actin-dependent processes mentioned above.
Polymerization/Nucleation: Proteins like the Actin-Related Protein 2/3 (ARP2/3) complex control the formation of new actin filaments, particularly the formation of branched networks involved in rapid responses.
In conclusion, the actin cytoskeleton is not merely a structural scaffold but a dynamic regulatory hub that couples cellular machinery to external and internal signals (like gravity and hormones) to precisely control the fundamental process of primary root growth.

"
                data-content="This study identifies and characterizes a novel plant-specific protein in Arabidopsis thaliana called HYPERSENSITIVE TO LATRUNCULIN B1 (HLB1), which plays a crucial role in regulating cellular trafficking by functioning at the intersection of the exocytic (outward) and endocytic (inward) pathways.
The core finding is that HLB1 is an essential component of the Trans-Golgi Network/Early Endosome (TGN/EE) and acts to coordinate vesicle trafficking with the actin cytoskeleton to ensure proper cell polarity and growth.
Key Functional and Localization Results:
TGN/EE Localization: HLB1 was found to localize primarily to the TGN/EE, which is the central sorting station for vesicles moving in and out of the cell. This localization suggests its role as a key regulator of cellular cargo delivery.
Actin Cytoskeleton Link: HLB1 was initially identified through a screen for mutants that were hypersensitive to Latrunculin B, a drug that disrupts the actin cytoskeleton. This demonstrated a strong link between HLB1 and actin dynamics.
The HLB1 protein was found to associate with actin filaments in vitro (in a dish) and its localization to the TGN/EE was dependent on a functional actin cytoskeleton in vivo (in the cell).
Role in Exocytosis and Endocytosis:
Exocytosis (Secretion): Loss of HLB1 function led to decreased secretion of the cell-wall polysaccharide Pectin, causing a buildup of Pectin within the TGN/EE compartments. This indicates a defect in the exocytic pathway (exporting materials).
Endocytosis (Uptake): HLB1 also regulates the endocytic pathway, specifically the trafficking of the auxin efflux carrier PIN2. In hlb1 mutant roots, the cycling of PIN2 between the plasma membrane and endosomes was altered, which is consistent with the observed defects in root growth polarity.
Protein Structure: HLB1 is a plant-specific protein containing a Tetratricopeptide Repeat (TPR) domain, which typically mediates protein-protein interactions. The TPR domain was shown to be necessary for the protein's function, particularly in regulating PIN2 trafficking and ensuring proper root development.
Phenotype and Significance:
Growth Defects: Loss of HLB1 function resulted in severe developmental defects, including reduced root growth and disruption of root hair elongation and polarity.
Coordination Hub: The study concludes that HLB1 is a critical component that integrates the TGN/EE trafficking network with the actin cytoskeleton to correctly sort and deliver cargo, thereby ensuring the anisotropic (directional) cell expansion required for proper plant growth and development. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4826010/">

"
                data-content="This study identifies and characterizes a novel Receptor-Like Kinase (RLK) named ERULUS in Arabidopsis thaliana that is essential for specifying and maintaining the tip-growth pattern of root hairs. The key finding is that ERULUS functions at the plasma membrane to precisely regulate the characteristic tip-focused cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cytâ€‹) oscillations, which are the fundamental signaling mechanism driving root hair elongation.
Key Functional Roles:
Tip-Growth Specificity: The ERULUS gene is highly expressed in root hairs and is required for their proper tip-growth morphology. The erulus mutant displayed severely shortened root hairs that often failed to initiate growth correctly.
Regulation of Calcium Oscillations:
Loss of Function: Root hairs in the erulus mutant exhibited significantly disrupted and reduced tip-focused [Ca2+]cytâ€‹ oscillations. These oscillations are normally characterized by regular increases in calcium concentration at the root hair tip, which correlate with cyclical growth surges.
Restoration: Introducing the functional ERULUS gene back into the mutant successfully restored the frequency and amplitude of the [Ca2+]cytâ€‹ oscillations and rescued the normal root hair growth phenotype.
Tip-Localized Protein Maintenance: ERULUS is required to maintain the tip localization of several proteins crucial for root hair elongation:
RHD2 (Respiratory burst oxidase homolog D): A plasma membrane NADPH oxidase that generates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which are also essential for tip-growth. In the mutant, RHD2 localization was severely impaired.
PIN2: The auxin efflux carrier involved in growth regulation. PIN2 localization was also disrupted in the erulus mutant.
Protein Characteristics and Location:
Receptor-Like Kinase: ERULUS belongs to the Malectin-Like RLK family. It is a plasma membrane-localized protein, with a large extracellular domain that is hypothesized to perceive an unknown ligand (a binding signal) to initiate its signaling cascade.
Cytoplasmic Domain: The cytoplasmic kinase domain of ERULUS is required for its function, as a kinase-dead version of the protein failed to rescue the mutant phenotype.
In conclusion, ERULUS acts as a crucial plasma membrane sensor that regulates the underlying signaling machineryâ€”specifically the tip-focused calcium oscillationsâ€”which is the central mechanism responsible for driving and maintaining the highly polarized and directional cell expansion characteristic of root hair tip-growth.

"
                data-content="This study investigates the role of the plant hormone Brassinosteroids (BRs) in regulating autotropic root straighteningâ€”the process by which a root returns to vertical growth after being displaced by an external stimulus. The key finding is that BRs inhibit this straightening process by altering the organization and dynamics of the filamentous-Actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton in the root's elongation zone.
Key Mechanisms of BR Inhibition:
Inhibition of Root Straightening: Exposure to exogenous BRs (e.g., brassinolide) caused a significant reduction in the rate of autotropic root straightening in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Roots treated with BRs took longer to re-establish vertical growth after being temporarily tilted.
Targeting the F-Actin Cytoskeleton: The study found that BRs specifically target and modify the F-actin network, which is crucial for root cell expansion and directional growth.
Decreased F-Actin Bundling: BR treatment led to a decrease in the bundling of F-actin filaments in the root's elongation zone. The thick, ordered actin cables necessary for directional cell growth were replaced by more fragmented and dispersed filaments.
Reduced F-Actin Dynamics: Using microscopy, the researchers observed a reduction in the dynamics (movement and turnover) of F-actin bundles. This disruption in dynamics is directly linked to defects in cellular processes that drive directional growth.
Altered Cellular Growth: The disorganization of F-actin caused by BRs resulted in a shift in cell expansion from anisotropic (directional) to more isotropic (uniform) growth in the elongation zone. This loss of directional growth is what fundamentally hinders the root's ability to straighten and correctly align with gravity.
Role of Actin-Associated Proteins:
The study utilized mutants for F-actin-associated proteins to confirm the link:
Villin and Actin Bundling: The effect of BRs was shown to be partially dependent on Villin, an F-actin bundling protein. This suggests that BRs may act by regulating Villin's activity or localization, thereby controlling the overall bundling of the actin network.
In conclusion, Brassinosteroids do not simply promote or inhibit overall root growth; rather, they act as a regulatory signal that modifies the F-actin cytoskeleton's structure and dynamics. This specific action leads to a loss of directional cell expansion, thereby inhibiting the process of autotropic root straightening. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010715/">

                data-content="This study addresses a gap in plant biology research by developing and characterizing a set of genetically-encoded reporter lines in Arabidopsis thaliana to visualize cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cytâ€‹) signaling with cell type-specificity in the seedling root.
The key achievement was generating lines expressing the fluorescent calcium indicator GCaMP3 driven by promoters specific to five distinct root cell types:
Columella cells (gravity-sensing, in the root cap)
Endodermis
Cortex
Epidermis
Trichoblasts (root hair cells, a subset of the epidermis)
Key Results and Validation:
Reporter Effectiveness: The study confirmed that GCaMP3, when expressed under these specific promoters, successfully reports [Ca2+]cytâ€‹ elevations in the targeted cell layers. This provides an essential tool for future research.
Unique Responses to Stressors: The new lines revealed that different root cell types exhibit unique [Ca2+]cytâ€‹ responses to environmental stressors, even within the same tissue.
Cold Shock: Exposure to cold shock (lowering temperature from 23âˆ˜C to 4âˆ˜C) induced a [Ca2+]cytâ€‹ transient (a brief, sharp increase) in all five cell types. This demonstrates that cold is a broad stimulus.
Mechanical Wounding (Handling Stress): The physical stress of handling the root (moving it for microscopy) primarily caused a [Ca2+]cytâ€‹ transient in the epidermis, cortex, and trichoblast cells. The inner endodermis and columella cells were less responsive or showed no clear transient, indicating that this stress signal is attenuated deeper within the root tissue.
Salt Stress (NaCl):
The columella cells showed the strongest and fastest [Ca2+]cytâ€‹ transient upon salt exposure.
The trichoblasts (root hair cells) displayed the smallest calcium increase.
The other cell types (cortex, endodermis, epidermis) showed intermediate responses. This cell-specific difference highlights the specialized roles of these cells in perceiving and responding to salinity.
Significance:
The development of these cell type-specific GCaMP3 lines enables researchers to dissect the complex [Ca2+]cytâ€‹ signaling network in plant roots with unprecedented resolution. The findings confirm that [Ca2+]cytâ€‹ responses are not uniform across the root but are tailored to the specific functions and environmental sensing roles of each cell type. This resource is vital for studying plant responses to abiotic stresses like gravity, cold, and salinity.

                data-content="This study investigates the roles of two key regulatory protein complexesâ€”SPIRRIG (SPI) and the WAVE/SCAR complex (WSC)â€”in controlling the organization of the actin cytoskeleton during the development and polarized growth of root hairs in Arabidopsis thaliana.
The core finding is that SPI and WSC function at the root hair tip to spatio-temporally regulate the Actin-Related Protein 2/3 (ARP2/3) complex, which is responsible for creating the branched actin network that drives tip-focused cell growth.
Key Functional and Localization Results:
Co-Localization at the Tip: Both the SPI protein and a component of the WSC (SOP2) were found to co-localize as a ring or collar structure at the root hair tip. This precise localization suggests they are positioned to regulate the tip-growth machinery.
Regulators of ARP2/3:
WAVE/SCAR Complex (WSC): The WSC acts as a direct activator of the ARP2/3 complex. The study confirmed that WSC is essential for generating the branched actin network at the growing tip.
SPIRRIG (SPI): SPI was found to be a positive regulator that acts upstream of WSC. The stability of WSC components at the root hair tip was dependent on SPI. Loss of SPI led to mislocalization of WSC and resulted in fewer actin filaments being produced.
Distinct Timing of Action: The study discovered that SPI and WSC play roles at different stages of root hair development:
Root Hair Initiation: The SPI protein is essential for the initial stages of root hair emergence and early tip-growth.
Root Hair Elongation: WSC proteins (like SOP2) are specifically required to sustain growth during the rapid elongation phase of the root hair.
Genetic Interaction: Genetic crossing experiments confirmed that SPI and WSC operate within the same pathway. The severe growth defects of spi mutants (which produce short, distorted root hairs) were not rescued by over-expressing WSC components, suggesting SPI must be present for WSC to function correctly.
In conclusion, SPI and WSC are crucial ARP2/3 regulators that operate sequentially and cooperatively at the root hair apex. SPI is required to properly position and stabilize WSC, which then activates the branched actin network necessary to drive the tip-focused cell expansion that defines root hair development.

                data-title="Impact of microgravity and lunar gravity on murine skeletal and immune systems during space travel(2024)"
                data-content="This study investigated the effects of different gravitational loadsâ€”microgravity (0 g), lunar gravity (1/6 g), and Earth gravity (1 g)â€”on the skeletal and immune systems of mice during a 25-35 day mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The mice were housed in a Multi-purpose Small Payload Rack (MSPR) with a Variable Gravity Research (VGR) centrifuge to create the different gravity conditions.
The core finding is that lunar gravity (1/6 g) provided partial but incomplete protection against the detrimental effects of microgravity on both bone density and the immune system.
1. Effects on the Skeletal System (Bone Density)
Microgravity (0 g) Damage: Exposure to microgravity resulted in a significant reduction in bone density and bone mass in the femurs of the mice.
Earth Gravity (1 g) Protection: Mice housed at 1 g on the ISS showed complete preservation of bone density and mass, with results comparable to ground controls.
Lunar Gravity (1/6 g) Partial Protection: Mice exposed to lunar gravity (1/6 g) showed only a partial recovery of bone mineral density compared to the 0 g group. The 1/6 g condition did not fully prevent the bone loss induced by the space environment.
2. Effects on the Immune System (Thymus and Spleen)
The study analyzed the weight and cellular composition of the thymus (T-cell development) and the spleen (a major lymphoid organ).
Microgravity (0 g) Damage: Both the thymus and the spleen of mice in microgravity showed significant atrophy (size reduction) and decreased cell numbers.
Earth Gravity (1 g) Protection: The 1 g environment completely prevented the atrophy of the thymus and spleen, maintaining their weight and cellularity near ground-control levels.
Lunar Gravity (1/6 g) Partial Protection: Similar to the skeletal system, the 1/6 g condition offered only partial prevention of the immune organ atrophy.
3. Gene Expression Analysis
Transcriptomic analysis of the spleen revealed:
Immune Suppression: Genes related to the immune response were downregulated in the 0 g group, consistent with immune suppression.
Inflammatory and Stress Response: Genes related to inflammation and the p53 stress response were upregulated in the 0 g group.
Gravity Dependence: The changes in gene expression in the 1 g group were minimal, confirming the effectiveness of artificial Earth gravity as a countermeasure. The gene expression profile in the 1/6 g group was intermediate between the 0 g and 1 g groups, further supporting the idea of partial protection at lunar gravity.
Conclusion and Significance
The study demonstrates that while 1 g artificial gravity is an effective countermeasure against spaceflight-induced damage to the skeletal and immune systems, lunar gravity (1/6 g) is insufficient to fully prevent these physiological compromises. These findings suggest that future missions establishing a permanent base on the Moon will require additional or enhanced countermeasures to fully protect astronauts from the negative health consequences of the reduced-gravity environment.

(2010)"
                data-content="This study investigated the oligomeric state (the number of protein subunits that form the functional complex) of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from Staphylococcus aureus (SaMscL). MscL is a crucial membrane protein that acts as a mechanosensor, opening in response to membrane tension to prevent cell lysis. The core issue addressed was the debate over MscL's subunit number, with previous in vitro (in a dish) structural studies yielding conflicting results (tetramer or pentamer).
The key finding is that the functional form of SaMscL is a pentamer (five subunits) in vivo (in a living cell), but its subunit number is unstable and variable when isolated in vitro using detergents.
Key Results on Oligomeric State:
In Vivo Determination (Disulfide-Trap): The researchers used a disulfide-trapping technique in live E. coli cells to lock the SaMscL subunits together. This technique, performed in the natural cell membrane, overwhelmingly demonstrated that SaMscL exists as a pentamer in its native environment.
In Vitro Variability (Analytical Ultracentrifugation): When SaMscL was purified and solubilized using various detergents (a necessary step for most structural studies like X-ray crystallography), analytical ultracentrifugation showed that the protein formed mixed oligomeric species (mixtures of four, five, and six subunits).
The choice of detergent significantly influenced the distribution of these mixed species.
Specifically, Dodecyl maltoside (DDM), a common detergent for membrane protein purification, showed a complex mixture of oligomers and led to a high propensity for aggregation.
Implications for Membrane Protein Research:
The study offers a crucial cautionary note regarding the study of all detergent-solubilized membrane proteins:
Detergent Artifacts: The variability in MscL's structure in vitro suggests that the choice of detergent can destabilize the native oligomeric state, potentially leading to misinterpretation of the protein's functional structure based on crystal data alone.
Methodology: The use of the disulfide-trap assay and other in vivo methods is emphasized as necessary to confirm the physiologically relevant oligomeric state before relying solely on in vitro structural models.
In conclusion, the native and functional SaMscL channel in the cell membrane is a pentamer, reinforcing the model established for the M. tuberculosis MscL. The study underscores the challenge that detergent-induced structural artifacts present in determining the true architecture of membrane proteins.

                data-content="This article serves as a follow-up investigation and confirmation of the structural state of the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from Staphylococcus aureus (SaMscL). MscL is a crucial bacterial emergency release valve that opens in response to membrane tension. The study's primary goal was to address the controversy over SaMscL's subunit number (oligomeric state), specifically whether it is a tetramer or a pentamer, and to examine the role of its C-terminal domain.
The core finding is a confirmation that the full-length and C-terminal-truncated versions of SaMscL are pentamers (five subunits) in vivo (in the native cell membrane).
Key Results:
In Vivo Stoichiometry Confirmed: Using the disulfide-trapping technique in live E. coli cells, the researchers confirmed that the full-length SaMscL is a pentamer, which is consistent with the MscL orthologs from M. tuberculosis and E. coli. This result validates previous findings and dismisses the SaMscL tetramer structure derived from a specific X-ray crystal structure.
Role of the C-Terminal Domain: The study investigated whether the highly flexible C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of SaMscL affects its oligomeric state.
A truncated SaMscL (lacking the C-terminal Î±-helix) was constructed and tested.
The results showed that even the truncated version of SaMscL retained its pentameric structure in vivo. This indicates that the C-terminal domain is not required for the channel to assemble into its functional pentameric state in the native membrane.
Implications for In Vitro Studies: The article supports the idea that the variability and incorrect stoichiometry (tetramer) previously observed for SaMscL were artifacts resulting from the use of detergents and manipulation of the protein outside of its native membrane environment (as suggested by the authors' previous 2010 study referenced in the text).
In conclusion, regardless of the presence of the C-terminal domain, SaMscL assembles as a pentamer in the live cell membrane, solidifying the pentameric model as the true functional state for the MscL family of mechanosensitive channels.

                data-content="This study investigated methods for precisely controlling and modulating the pore size of the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from Escherichia coli (EcoMscL). MscL is a homopentameric channel that opens in response to membrane tension and is being explored for use as a triggered nanovalve in biotechnological applications like targeted drug delivery.
The core finding is that the pore size of MscL can be reliably modulated using three distinct and independent mechanisms by engineering specific mutations, allowing for the fine-tuning of its conductance and functional use as a nanovalve.
The Three Routes to Modulate Pore Size:
Deletion of a Constricting Loop (Structural Modification):
The C-terminal Î±-helix of EcoMscL contains a small, highly conserved loop (A110-A112) that constricts the channel entrance.
Deletion of this A110-A112 loop significantly increased the single-channel conductance (pore size) from the wild-type (WT) value of âˆ¼85 pA to âˆ¼100-120 pA (at âˆ’80 mV). This modification creates a larger, more conductive nanovalve.
Chemical Modification of Engineered Cysteine Residues (Covalent Gating):
Route: Cysteine residues were engineered into the A110-A112 loop, creating a A110-A112C mutant.
Action: When treated with the sulfhydryl-specific reagent MTSET+ (which covalently binds to cysteine), the pore size was decreased (lowered conductance).
Reversal: Subsequent treatment with a reducing agent, DTT, restored the channel's conductance back toward the WT level. This demonstrates a method for reversible chemical modulation of the nanovalve's size.
Metal-Ion Coordination (Controllable Blockage):
Route: Histidine residues (H) were introduced into the constricting loop (A110H or A112H).
Action: The addition of divalent zinc ions (Zn2+) caused a significant and rapid reduction in single-channel conductance. The Zn2+ ions coordinate between the engineered histidine residues on adjacent subunits, effectively constricting or blocking the pore.
Reversal: This blockade was reversible upon the removal of the Zn2+ from the solution, demonstrating a route for external, on-demand control of pore size via an ionic signal.
In conclusion, the study successfully demonstrated three independent and tunable engineering strategies (structural deletion, chemical modification, and metal-ion coordination) to precisely modulate the pore size of the MscL channel. This research is critical for advancing the use of MscL as a biologically-based, externally-triggered nanovalve in various bionanotechnology applications.

(2012)"
                data-content="This study investigates the dynamic interactions between the N-terminal amphipathic helix (S1) and the cytoplasmic interface of the second transmembrane helix (TM2ciâ€‹) of the Mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (EcoMscL) from Escherichia coli. MscL is a crucial bacterial sensor that serves as an emergency release valve, opening a large pore to protect the cell from lysis upon osmotic shock. The goal was to understand how these two domains, which are close in the closed-state crystal structure, interact during the channel's opening process (gating).
The core finding is that the interaction between S1 and TM2ciâ€‹ is maintained but weakened as the MscL channel opens in response to membrane tension, demonstrating that the channel's N-terminal domain moves with the transmembrane domain during gating.
Key Results and Mechanism:
Disulfide Trapping Methodology: The researchers used a systematic approach of screening 143 double-cysteine mutants of EcoMscL. In this technique, the formation of a disulfide bond between two engineered cysteine residues is used to covalently lock the two subunits together at that position. By measuring the channel's activity (gating) after bond formation, they could determine how close the two positions are in different functional states.
Interaction in the Closed State: In the closed state (low membrane tension), disulfide bonds readily formed between residues in the S1 helix and TM2ciâ€‹, which supports the crystal structure's model of a close association between these domains.
Interaction in the Open State: Applying high membrane tension to open the channel:
Caused fewer cysteine pairs to form bonds, suggesting that the distance between the S1 and TM2ciâ€‹ domains increases upon channel opening.
For the bonds that did form, they had a weaker inhibitory effect on channel function compared to the closed state.
Dynamic Conformational Change: The results indicate that the entire N-terminal domain, including the S1 helix, undergoes a coordinated movement with the transmembrane domains during gating. Specifically:
The S1 helix remains near the cytoplasmic membrane surface, consistent with its amphipathic (both water- and lipid-interacting) nature.
The tilting and iris-like movement of the transmembrane helices upon opening pulls the TM2ciâ€‹ region outward and apart, which subsequently loosens, but does not break, the interaction with S1.
In conclusion, the study provides functional evidence that the protein-protein interactions at the cytoplasmic-lipid interface are dynamically maintained during the mechanical gating of MscL, demonstrating a coordinated movement between the N-terminal regulatory domain and the central channel core.

                data-content="This article provides a mini-review comparing and contrasting the two major families of bacterial Mechanosensitive (MS) channels, MscS (Small conductance) and MscL (Large conductance), and discussing their role as microbial emergency release valves. These channels are crucial for single-celled organisms to survive acute osmotic downshock (a sudden drop in external salt concentration).
1. Core Function: The Emergency Release Valve
Mechanism: Both MscS and MscL are membrane-embedded proteins that sense a rapid increase in membrane tension (stretch) caused by the inward flow of water during hypoosmotic stress.
Physiological Role: They act as biological safety valves, opening large pores to allow cytoplasmic solutes and water to be rapidly jettisoned from the cell. This rapid release decreases the internal turgor pressure, preventing the cell from bursting (lysis). Most microbes possess members of one or both families.
2. Comparison of MscL and MscS Channels
Feature
MscL (Large Conductance)
MscS (Small Conductance)
Pore Size/Conductance
Very large (âˆ¼3 nS). Capable of passing large solutes.
Smaller (âˆ¼1 nS). Capable of passing smaller molecules.
Structure
Homopentamer (5 identical subunits).
Homoseptamer (7 identical subunits).
Activation Threshold
High threshold. Requires substantial membrane tension (i.e., extreme osmotic shock) to open.
Lower threshold. Opens readily at lower membrane tension.
Gating Mechanism
Undergoes dramatic, iris-like rotation and tilting of transmembrane helices to open a massive pore.
Undergoes more subtle, piston-like movements of helices.
Physiological Timing
The last resort channel; opens after MscS when turgor is dangerously high.
The first responder channel; opens earlier to relieve mild to moderate pressure.

3. Expanded Physiological Roles
While traditionally viewed as osmotic emergency valves, the discovery of MscS and MscL homologues in other organisms and organelles complicates this simple view:
MscS in Plants: MscS homologues have been found in the chloroplasts of plants, where they are thought to protect these organelles from hypoosmotic stress during normal cellular function (e.g., movement between the cytosol and vacuole).
MscL Beyond Bacteria: MscL homologues have been identified in the genomes of certain fungi and mycoplasma, suggesting a more widespread physiological role beyond just osmotic shock survival in free-living bacteria.
In conclusion, both MscS and MscL are master regulators of cell volume, responding sequentially to increasing membrane tension to ensure microbial survival. MscS acts first to alleviate moderate pressure, and MscL acts last as the fail-safe to prevent catastrophic cell lysis.

                data-title="Chimeras reveal a single lipid-interface residue that controls MscL channel kinetics as well as mechanosensitivity
(2013)"
                data-content="This study investigates the functional differences between two homologous bacterial Mechanosensitive channels of large conductance (MscL) from Escherichia coli (EcoMscL) and Staphylococcus aureus (SaMscL). MscL is a highly conserved emergency release valve that protects the cell from lysis by opening in response to membrane tension.
The core finding is that a single residue at the periplasmic-lipid interface of the first transmembrane domain (TM1) is the primary determinant controlling both the mechanosensitivity (threshold) and the open dwell time (kinetics) of the MscL channel.
Key Results on Mechanosensitivity and Kinetics:
Identified Critical Residue: The study focused on E. coli residue I49 and its equivalent in S. aureus, F47. These residues are located at the interface where the channel protein interacts with the lipid bilayer, near the periplasmic (outer) face of the membrane.
Controlling the Threshold:
By swapping the residues (e.g., creating the EcoMscL I49F mutant and the SaMscL F47I mutant), the researchers were able to tune the pressure threshold required to open the channel (mechanosensitivity).
Hydrophobic substitutions at this position generally resulted in a higher opening pressure (less sensitive), while less hydrophobic substitutions resulted in a lower opening pressure (more sensitive).
This suggests the residue acts as a fulcrum or spring that regulates the mechanical resistance to channel opening.
Controlling the Kinetics (Open Dwell Time):
The same residue also drastically influenced the open dwell time (Ï„3â€‹)â€”how long the channel stays open before closing.
For the EcoMscL protein, the substitution I49F (replacing a smaller, less hydrophobic residue with a larger, more hydrophobic one) caused a significant increase in the open dwell time, stabilizing the open state.
One mutant exhibited severe hysteresis, meaning it took a much higher pressure to open than it did to close, confirming the residue's critical role in determining the energy barriers for channel gating.
Mechanism Proposed: The study proposes that this residue sits at a crucial hinge point between the membrane-spanning helices and the lipid environment. The properties of the side chain (specifically its hydrophobicity and size) dictate how tightly the channel is clamped in its closed state, thereby setting both the force required to break the clamp (mechanosensitivity) and the stability of the opened structure (kinetics).
In conclusion, the residue at the TM1 periplasmic-lipid interface (I49 F47) is a single, key determinant of MscL function, acting to adjust the energy barriers for both opening and closing, a finding critical for understanding the molecular mechanism of mechanosensing.

(2016)"
                data-content="This article is a reply by the original authors (Boothby and Goldstein) defending their finding of extensive Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) in the tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini genome, which had faced skepticism and challenges from other research groups sequencing the same genome.
Core Defense of the HGT Finding:
Data Cleaning and Contamination: The main criticism was that the HGT genes identified were actually contaminants (e.g., from bacteria or fungi) associated with the tardigrade. The authors state that they were aware of contamination issues, which is common in small, slow-growing organisms, and had implemented filtering methods.
Support from New Assemblies: They argue that while the independent genome assemblies reported by other groups (Bemm et al. and Koutsovoulos et al.) were smaller and cleaner, they still retained hundreds to thousands of foreign genes initially identified in the original assembly, supporting the core finding of significant HGT.
Confirmation of Expression: The authors point to RNA-Seq data (gene expression data) from Arakawa's group, which showed that many of the foreign genes were actively transcribed in the tardigrade cells. The expression of a gene is a strong indicator that it is a bona fide part of the tardigrade's functional genome, not merely a contaminant passing through the gut.
Mistake Acknowledged: They acknowledge a critical mistake: they had mistakenly uploaded an outdated, larger (252 Mb) assembly to public databases instead of the 212.3 Mb assembly used in their published paper. This error likely exacerbated the contamination concerns for external researchers.
Conclusion:
The authors maintain that while the true extent of HGT may be lower than their initial estimate, the combined evidence from all groups' independent genome assemblies and the transcription of these foreign genes demonstrates that HGT is a genuine and extensive biological phenomenon in H. dujardini, making the tardigrade genome evolutionarily unique.

"
                data-content="This study focuses on a specific family of proteins from tardigrades (Hypsibius dujardini), the microscopic animals famous for surviving extreme desiccation (drying out). These proteins are called secretory-abundant heat soluble (SAHS) proteins, a type of tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered protein (TDP). The research investigated the mechanism by which SAHS proteins protect biological structures and assessed their potential for biotechnological use.
The core finding is that SAHS proteins, when applied extracellularly (outside the cell), can protect various biological structures from damage caused by desiccation.
Key Results and Mechanisms:
Extracellular Protection: SAHS proteins were found to be effective even when applied externally.
They prevented the fusion of desiccated liposomes (artificial cell membranes), suggesting they stabilize cell membranes by acting on the outer surface.
They enhanced the desiccation tolerance of E. coli (a bacterium) and Rhizobium tropici (another bacterium) when added to the external medium.
Structural Transition Model:
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and comparative structural analysis suggested a unique mechanism: SAHS proteins contain a large internal cavity and a Î²-sheet-rich structure.
In the hydrated (wet) state, this cavity is filled with water and solutes.
Upon desiccation, the removal of water and solutes destabilizes the Î²-sheet structure, suggesting the protein undergoes a structural change that is key to its protective function.
Potential Applications: The ability of SAHS proteins to stabilize cellular and membranous structures from the outside highlights their potential for use as stabilizing molecules for the long-term preservation of cells, liposomes, and other biological materials without the need for genetic modification of the host cells.
In conclusion, SAHS proteins function as powerful, secreted protectants that stabilize cellular components against the physical stress of desiccation, offering novel insights into tardigrade survival and providing a tool for preservation in bionanotechnology.
